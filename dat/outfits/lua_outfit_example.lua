--[[

Example of what can be done with Lua outfits. This is only the Lua-side of the
API and must be set in the XML file. This only works for *Modifier* outfits!

* All functions are optional. In the case they don't exist, nothing happens.
* ontoggle is a special case that allows the player to toggle the outfit if it exists.
* All functions take the pilot equipping the outfit 'p' and the pilot outfit 'po' as parameters.
* They are run in a shared state. All global variables will be the same for all outfits of the same type.
* You can use the 'mem' table to access memory for the particular outfit being used.
* You have access to the pilotoutfit API which is meant for manipulating po.
* Use the <desc_extra> field in the XML when describing what the Lua does.

-- The 'notactive' variable controls whether the outfit is considered an active
-- outfit or not. By default, it is set to nil and thus the outfit is
-- considered an active outfit. It can be used to have outfits with custom
-- descriptions or prices while not being an active outfit.
notactive = false

-- The onload is run once when the outfit Lua is loaded. Useful for setting up
-- variables. The passed variable is the outfit itself.
function onload( _o )
end

-- Called to get the extra description of the outfit. This gets appended to the
-- summary and description, and should be short. The function receives the
-- pilot p if applicable, and the current outfit o. The function should return
-- a translated string.
function descextra( _p, _o )
   return _("This outfit is very cool.")
end

-- Called when the price of the outfit for the player is check
-- Returns 3 values, the cost string, whether the player can buy it, and
-- whether the player can sell it
function price( q )
   local pricestr = string.format("%d credits",500*q) -- Use format library instead
   local canbuy = true
   local cansell = true
   return pricestr, canbuy, cansell
end

-- Run when the player tries to buy an outfit. Should determine whether the
-- outfit was bought or not (deducting costs), or return false and the reason
-- for not being able to buy the outfit.
function buy( q )
   player.pay( -500*q, "outfit_buy" )
   return true, q
   --return false, reason
end

-- Run when the player tries to sell an outfit. Should determine whether the
-- outfit was sold or not (deducting costs), or return false and the reason
-- for not being able to sell the outfit.
function sell( q )
   player.pay( 500*q, "outfit_sell" )
   return true, q
   --return false, reason
end

-- The init is run when the pilot is created or enters a new system (takeoff/jumpin)
function init( _p, _po )
end

-- The function is run when the outfit is added to the pilot
function onadd( _p, _po )
end

-- The function is run when the outfit is removed from the pilot
function onremove( _p, _po )
end

-- The update function is run periodically every 1/3 seconds
-- 'dt' is the time elapsed since last time run in seconds
function update( _p, _po, _dt )
end

-- When the pilot is out of energy, this function triggers. Note that before
-- this triggers, 'ontoggle( p, po false )' will be run if it exists.
-- This is especially useful for outfits that can't be toggled, but want to
-- turn off when they run out of energy.
function outofenergy( _p, _po )
end

-- The onhit function is run when the pilot 'p' takes damage
-- armour is the amount of armour damage taken (in GJ)
-- shield is the amount of shield damage taken (in GJ)
-- attacker is the pilot that attacked
function onhit( _p, _po, _armour, _shield, _attacker )
end

-- The onshoot function is run when the pilot 'p' shoots ANY weapon. This includes primary / secondary / instant weapon sets
function onshootany( _p, _po )
end

-- The ontoggle function allows the oufit to be toggled by the player
-- on is whether it was toggled "on" or "off" and is a boolean value
-- the function returns whether or not the outfit changed state
function ontoggle( _p, _po, _on )
   return false
end

-- The onstealth function runs when the pilot stealths or destealths
-- stealthed the current stealth status of the pilot
function onstealth( _p, _po, _stealthed )
end

-- Run when the pilot is scanned by a scanner pilot.
function onscanned( _p, _po, _scanner )
end

-- Run when the pilot scans a target pilot.
function onscan( _p, _po, _target )
end

-- The cooldown function is triggered when both cooldown starts and when
-- it ends. The done is a boolean value which indicates whether or not it
-- finished. In the case done is false, opt will indicate the number of
-- seconds the cooldown will take. If done is true, then opt will be a
-- a boolean indicating whether or not it successfully completed.
function cooldown( _p, _po, _done, _opt )
end

-- Triggered when pilot lands (player only)
function land( _p, _po )
end

-- Triggered when pilot takes off (player only)
function takeoff( _p, _po )
end

-- Triggered when pilot jumps in (player only)
function jumpin( _p, _po )
end

-- Triggered when pilot boards a target ship
function board( _p, _po, _target )
end

-- Triggered when the player double taps a specific key, which can be either "accel", "left", or "right". Should return true if it activated something
function keydoubletap( _p, _po, _key )
end

-- Triggered when the player releases a specific key, same as "keydoubletap"
function keyrelease( _p, _po, _key )
end

--[[
   Below are WEAPONS ONLY. However, they can be triggered by munitions,
   which share the memory with the ORIGINAL spawning outfit.

   Note that these are calculated with particles.
--]]
-- Triggered when the weapon is about to shoot and can be used to control
-- whether or not it should be able to shoot. By returning true, it'll start
-- firing the weapon, while returning false will block in from shooting.
function onshoot( _p, _po )
   return false
end
-- Triggered when a particle shot by p impacts the target. p may not exist if
-- the pilot that shot the weapon ceased to exist.
function onimpact( _p, _target, _pos, _vel, _o )
end
--- Triggered when a particle times out without hitting a target. p may not
--exist if the pilot that shot the weapon ceased to exist.
function onmiss( _p, _pos, _vel, _o )
