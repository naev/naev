  <description>The ZIBS-32 was a topic of much controversy when it was first developed, almost leading to important ruptures between multiple military engineering teams. The larger more powerful prototype had just been developed, making use of two 16-side faceted polyhedral focusing crystals that would merge into the primary beam. The original prototype was called the ZIBS-32, which many other engineers took as a personal affront, considering that it should be called the ZIBS-16x2 (or perhaps even the ZIBS-2x16). Eventually, after many strongly worded letters, several resignations, and the hijacking of a Za'lek Battleship, the issue was officially closed with the name ZIBS-32, and any further discussion became taboo. Although some say you can still find drunk disgruntled Za'lek engineers grumbling about the ZIBS-16x2 in spaceport bars across the House Za'lek territory.</description>
