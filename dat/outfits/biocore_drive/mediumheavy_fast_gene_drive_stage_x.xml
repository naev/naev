  <description>The gene drive is a Soromid bioship's equivalent to engines in synthetic ships. It is charged with moving the organism through space and comes in either a strong form (for heavy loads) or a fast form (for greater speed and agility). This gene drive has reached Stage X, its full potential.</description>
