  <description>The blink drive uses hyperdrive technology modified to create a small space-time fold allowing ships to instantly cross short distances. Pilots who often use such devices tend to have a higher amount of strong headaches than usual, but it must be safe, right?</description>
  <desc_extra>Blinks you 500 units in the direction you are facing. Double tapping left or right allows blinking 250 units to the side. Can only be run once every 7 seconds. Performance degrades over 1,000 tonnes of mass.</desc_extra>
