  <description>Designed by the Mining Vrata Guildhouse, the Catalytic Energy Drill takes a radical new approach on asteroid mining, increasing efficiency and power at the expense of ease of use. Instead of basing itself on more stable plasma technology, it uses a multi-stage crystallite accelerator to focus an energy beam. Although this results in a really compact and efficient design, due to a tendency to overheat and self-destruct, the operating time is significantly reduced, making skill an important factor in its successful usage.</description>
