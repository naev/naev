  <description>Not much unlike the Neural Accelerator Interface, the Emergency Stasis Inducer creates a strong electromagnetic field around the ship, making time appear to move slower for everything outside the ship while causing the ship itself and everything inside to speed up, allowing it to move faster and do far more damage than normal. Its implementation is tuned for a ship with its shields down, the lack of interference allowing for much greater potency of the effect. The mechanism is triggered automatically upon armour damage, without need of manual intervention.</description>
  <desc_extra>Triggered on armour damage. Lasts 3 seconds with 8 seconds cooldown.</desc_extra>
