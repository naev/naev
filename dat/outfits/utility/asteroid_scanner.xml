  <description>Any scanner can give the mass, position and velocity of an asteroid. But miners prefer to know the asteroid's value. For that purpose, Milspec designed a scanner array able to deduce the surface composition from spectroscopy, and, what is more impressive, to infer the internal composition via inverse electrical impedance. Of course, that comes at a price that not just any miner can pay.</description>
