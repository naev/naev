  <description>The Berserk Chip is a dangerous used by only the most reckless of pilots. It can be fully integrated into a ship to override most of the basic functionality to reroute it into combat capabilities. This comes at a very high expense to the hull integrity and systems on the ship and can only be used for a short time. Newer versions have a safety shutoff which automatically turn off the chip before hull integrity collapses.</description>
  <desc_extra>Incurs a large amount of shield and armour damage over time, and shuts down automatically when hull integrity is below 30%. After use, there is an 8 second cooldown period during which movement and damage output is decreased by 20%.</desc_extra>
