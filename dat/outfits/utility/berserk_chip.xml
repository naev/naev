  <description>The Berserk Chip is a dangerous thing, used by only the most reckless of pilots. It can be integrated into a ship to override most of the basic functionality, rerouting it into combat capabilities. This comes at a very high expense to the internal systems and physical condition of the ship and can only be used for a short time. Newer versions have a safety shutoff which automatically turn off the chip before hull integrity collapses.</description>
  <desc_extra>Incurs a large amount of shield and armour damage over time, and shuts down automatically when hull integrity is below 20%.</desc_extra>
