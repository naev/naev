  <description>When hauling large amounts of cargo, general-purpose ship engines may become overwhelmed and deliver a subpar performance. This device can be installed within a ship's cargo bays to generate a weak directed gravitational field to reduce the impact of cargo inertia on the ship's mobility and offset the requirement for bulkier engines.</description>
