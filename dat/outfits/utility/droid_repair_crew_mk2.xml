  <description>Compared to the base model, the Droid Repair Crew MK2 is able to patch up the ship's hull at twice the speed using a new assorted set of tools, included the coveted PatchiGel©. However, this comes with a trade-off of being even more ineffective unless the hull is at fairly critical conditions, when the gel is most effective.</description>
