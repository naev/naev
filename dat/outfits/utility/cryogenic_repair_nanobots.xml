  <description>Repair nanobots are able to perform what seems nothing short of a miracle, restoring the hull and armour of ships to pristine condition. While they show remarkable behaviour in laboratory conditions, in practice they need a fairly still environment to work in. The active cooling stage of a ship provides an excellent opportunity for the nanobots to show what they are fully capable of, however when the ship is in motion they go into hibernation.</description>
