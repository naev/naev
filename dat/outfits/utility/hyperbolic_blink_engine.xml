  <description>The hyperbolic blink engine seems to be designed as a response to the question "How much mass is it possible to move across a space-time fold?". It seems to disregard significantly about actually being able to control such space-time folding, and only focuses on whether or not is possible. Due to the heavy amount of disruption to the ship's systems and personnel, after each space-time fold or "blink", it takes a while for the ship to be fully responsive again.</description>
  <desc_extra>Warms up for 2 seconds then blinks you 2000 units in roughly the direction you are facing. Can only be run once every 8 seconds and incurs a 20% thrust and turn penalty during cooldown. Performance degrades over 6000 tonnes of mass.</desc_extra>
