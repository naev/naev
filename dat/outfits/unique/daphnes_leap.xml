  <description>This is a module that interfaces with the navigation system of a ship, modifying the core behaviour. By pushing to the limit the jump point detection and calibration system, it is able to execute the required preparations well in advance to jump at a moment's notice, however, this comes at the cost of increasing the overall time needed to jump due to necessary in-flight calibration.</description>
