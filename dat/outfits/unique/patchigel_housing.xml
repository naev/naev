  <description>Usually used by repairers when performing critical ship maintenance on the field, PatchiGel quickly allows keeping a highly damaged hull spaceworthy. Although designed for exterior application, housing it under the primary plating allows for quick application to the damaged areas, resulting in a self-healing armour that further increases in healing capacity as damaged. The downside is that it takes up the valuable space necessary for a secondary hull layer.</description>
