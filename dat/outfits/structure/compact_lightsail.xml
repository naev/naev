  <description>Not much unlike the more primitive solar sails widely used prior to the Second Growth, this is a small array of panels made to exploit sunlight and similar radiation to propel the ship along. While not useful as a sole method of propulsion, it can provide a minor aid in the ship's acceleration.</description>
