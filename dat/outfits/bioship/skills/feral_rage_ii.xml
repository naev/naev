  <description>Through careful manipulation of the brain stem, the bioship can be induced into a primitive state of feral rage in which forward and turret weapon output is significantly increased. Armour damage is needed to enter the trance-like state. Further coupling with the cerebellum allows the trance to also increase the ship agility temporarily.</description>
