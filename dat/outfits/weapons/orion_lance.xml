  <description>The Orion Lance is a fixed-mount weapon designed to be mounted on fighters and up. Based on a heavily-modified, liquid-cooled laser, it's capable of bursts of continuous fire, resulting in a destructive beam. Due to the large energy usage and need for focus, like the Particle Lance, the Orion Beam shares a fairly limiting short range. That said, very few enemy ships survive the encounter once they are in range.</description>
