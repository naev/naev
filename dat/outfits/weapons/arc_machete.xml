  <description>This weapon unleashes a focused beam of disabling electromagnetic radiation, able to both effectively shred through a target's shielding and render its equipment inoperable in a short amount of time without causing substantial physical harm. It's favoured by the few well-off pirate captains able to get their hands on one, as well as law enforcement on the hunt for those pirates, for similar reasons.</description>
