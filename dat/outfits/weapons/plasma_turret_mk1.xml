  <description>The plasma turret essentially takes a plasma blaster and mounts it on a turret. Its short range makes it ill-suited for defence, so it is not especially popular with traders and merchants, but it has found a niche among inexperienced mercenaries who are not as well-practiced at aiming as the pros.</description>
