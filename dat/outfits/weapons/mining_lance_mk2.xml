  <description>Mining lances are optimized for high destructive power at short range, specialized in mining space asteroids. While they can deal significant damage to heavy armour, they are impractical against shields. The Mining Lance MK2 uses its larger size to overcome one of the main drawbacks of the Mining Lance MK1, namely that the short range creates a tendency for mining ships to get caught up and damaged by the exploding asteroids. The Mining Vrata reports a large number of such incidents every year in their mining safety analysis reports.</description>
