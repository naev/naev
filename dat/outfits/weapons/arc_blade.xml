  <description>One of the prized weapons of the Black Lotus Armoury. The Arc Blade is an upscaled version of the Arc Machete, optimized for wrecking havoc on the systems of unsuspecting ships. Most commonly seen on Dealbreaker Battleships that prowl the area between House Za'lek and House Dvaered in search of careless merchant vessels who have not paid the protection racket. Very few pirate captains who purchase it regret their decision.</description>
