  <description>Milspec enjoys its monopoly over the premium system core market, and so is inexorably drawn to House Za'lek, who make the highest-performance computers in human space. Partnering with them, they made the most powerful ship-based computer systems in existence in the form of their Thalos series, and are the preferred choice on their military and civilian ships, which are packed full of extremely demanding hardware. While the 2202 is not found on their military craft, it is a favorite of scoutships and bombers that strain to fit the most advanced hardware possible without sacrificing the weight to upgrade to bulkier subsystems. </description>
