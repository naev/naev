  <description>Milspec enjoys its monopoly over the premium system core market, and so is inexorably drawn to House Za'lek, who make the highest-performance computers in human space. Partnering with them, they made the most powerful ship-based computer systems in existence in the form of their Thalos series, and are the preferred choice on their military and civilian ships, which are packed full of extremely demanding hardware. The Thalos 3604 has peerless subsystem control for the most demanding advanced weapons that can be reasonably affixed to smaller ships. They are popular with the most discerning of mercenaries and miners who like keeping extra tricks up their dirty sleeves.</description>
