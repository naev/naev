  <description> Milspec's popularity lies in the niche markets it can fill, and the Dvaered are no exception to this. The Prometheus series was conceived for older tech ships still in production and circulation that rely more on their armor for protection, and may have inadequate electronics for modern weapons. The 2203 is the lightest of these, and is popular on ships that need a lighter systems core that can still deliver good subsystem management as well as top of the line energy output, or pilots of heavier fighters or couriers trying to fit faster engines while keeping their ship's weight down. </description>
