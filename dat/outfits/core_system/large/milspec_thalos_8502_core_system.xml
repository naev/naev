  <description>Milspec contracts with House Za'lek to provide system cores capable of handling their advanced technology, and this one is no exception. Though technically classified as a light cruiser core, this system can handle the immense strain of managing both extensive drone and fighter commands and capital turret batteries, making it a popular choice for light cruiser pilots who prefer to stay agile while wielding the most advanced weapons they can manage to fit on their ships. </description>
