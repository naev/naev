  <description>Milspec enjoys its monopoly over the premium system core market, and so is inexorably drawn to House Za'lek, who make the highest-performance computers in human space. Partnering with them, they made the most powerful ship-based computer systems in existence in the form of their Thalos series, and are the preferred choice on their military and civilian ships, which are packed full of extremely demanding hardware. The 4702 is the lightest of these used on Za'lek warships, and is capable of handling a wide suite of weapons ranging from fighter docks to beam weapons. It sees some popularity with some destroyer captains as well, who see the benefit in having a mix of high performance engines and weapon batteries at a reduced weight. </description>
