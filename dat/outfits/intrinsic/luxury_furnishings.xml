  <description>Most ships are designed to withstand the harshness of space, with the comfort of the pilot and crew as a nearly forgotten secondary concern. Realizing that not every captain wants to command a sealed coffin, and inspired by the success of the Gawain, Nexus Shipyards now provides a full luxurious overhaul of a ship. Velvet curtains, cushioned panel coating, fully automatic bidets, and a Captain's Chair with 27 degrees of freedom and a 500-page manual are just some of the perks that are included in this ship make-over.</description>O
