  <description>Although many ships go through a tuning process during their mass production, it is far from perfect with imperfections leading to suboptimal performance. Port and polish consists of a complete in-depth tuning of the ship to bring out its best. Since it requires taking apart, fine-tuning, and putting back together large parts of a ship, the cost increases significantly with the size of the ship.</description>
