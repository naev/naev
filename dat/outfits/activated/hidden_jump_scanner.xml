  <description>A specialized piece of sensor technology that can scan its immediate surroundings for unusual anomalies in the fabric of space. Although short ranged and only capable of scanning for a limited amount of time before needing to recharge, this scanner is capable of discovering jump points that regular sensors can't detect.</description>
