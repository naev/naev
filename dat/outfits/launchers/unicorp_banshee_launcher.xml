  <description>The Banshee class heavy rocket is sometimes labeled the "poor man's torpedo". It has a relatively weak engine, but packs a powerful punch that can do respectable damage even to capital ships. This launcher is small enough to be mounted on medium hardpoints, and light enough on system load to be an interesting choice for bombers.</description>
