  <description>The Banshee class heavy dumbfire rocket is sometimes labeled the "poor man's torpedo". It has a relatively weak engine, but packs a powerful punch that can do respectable damage even to capital ships. The launcher is small and light enough to be usable by even small fighters, which makes it a great choice for bombers.</description>
