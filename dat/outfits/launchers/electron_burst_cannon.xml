  <description>This powerful energy weapon is built to bombard a target from great range with ion bursts, causing debilitating damage to a target's shields and electrical systems, which can leave a ship effectively crippled. It is unclear who originally designed this weapon: Robosys or the Za'lek. Either way, the drones that use this weapon are rightly feared and respected.</description>
