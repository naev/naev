  <description>One of the greatest advancements the Thurion have made was in the field of non-corporeal computation. While it wasn't the original intention, the self-contained energy cascades that are capable of doing simple calculations are used as weapons. While such weapons have very high computational requirements, the homing energy projectiles have a high chance of hitting an evasive target.</description>
