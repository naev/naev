  <description>The Banshee class heavy rocket is sometimes labeled the "poor man's torpedo". It has a relatively weak engine, but packs a powerful punch that can do respectable damage even to capital ships. TeraCom has equipped its Banshee launcher model with high grade reload and tube cooling systems, giving a significant boost to rate of fire.</description>
