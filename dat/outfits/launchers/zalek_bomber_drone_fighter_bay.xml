  <description>This relatively bulky drone is built to crack open large ships from afar. It accomplishes this task admirably. Drone Fighters require no pilot making them a safer approach in dangerous situations. They do however need some careful maintenance. All the tools needed to take care of them are provided with the bay.</description>
