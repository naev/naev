  <description>TeraCom decided not to develop a launcher for the Caesar IV, because it fell short of the company's performance requirements. Instead, the company released a completely new torpedo specification. At present, the Imperator class heavy torpedo provides devastating destructive power, though it will take a while for it to reach its target. Faster cruisers may be able to outrun it completely.</description>
