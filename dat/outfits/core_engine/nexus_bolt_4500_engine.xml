  <description>The Bolt 4500 is a mid-range engine designed for light cruisers. Like most Nexus engines, it doesn't excel in any particular aspect, but its lack of over-specialization allows it to be flexible, whether it's propelling a cruiser into combat or moving a freighter through a system.</description>
