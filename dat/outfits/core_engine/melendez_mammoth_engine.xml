  <description>Melendez's Mammoth can pull incredible amounts of mass. Requiring specialized grav tethers to keep it attached to the ship's hull, it significantly impacts manoeuvrability, though a reasonable top speed can still be maintained. Many bulk freight corporations only turn a profit thanks to the Mammoth line of engines.</description>
