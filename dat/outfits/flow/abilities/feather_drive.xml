  <description>While most modern travel techniques rely on folding space to make long distance become short, the feather drive technique uses flow to unfold the ship instead. This not only allows a ship to nearly instantly travel short distances, hostile ships that are hit have their energy drain, and the residual psychic shockwaves additionally slow them down.</description>
