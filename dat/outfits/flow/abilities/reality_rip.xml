  <description>A technique developed by a dreamer pirate only known as "Snort", by focusing large amounts of flow into a very concentrated area, and then letting it overpower your psyche to become one with the void, it is possible to create what can only be described as a rip in reality. Unlike the more controlled flow abilities that can distinguish between friend and foe, the uncontrolled field affects all ships alike, seemingly slowing time on the outside.</description>
