   <description>Adham is a cold, lifeless planet. The only reason why there is a landing strip here at all is that the planet hosts the three arctic-themed arenas for Totoran's gladiatiorial games. While the landing zone and a small buffer around it is considered neutral territory, most of the planet's surface is subject to the destructive sport that is so popular among Totoran's visitors.</description>

   <description>A cold and unpleasant world, the Sirius established their colony on Adrian in the days when they were just expanding into Eiderdown. At the time the system was controlled by the Empire, but with a firm beachhead in the system it was a matter of a few cycles before the Sirii came to power. Today, Adrian persists, despite having served its only purpose.</description>
   <bar>Heating on P class worlds is often a costly affair, so the temperature is kept at an acceptable, though uncomfortable low. Most patrons of this spaceport bar are in full winter getups.</bar>

   <description>Aillis is the base of operations for miners who mine Koralis VI. Koralis VI itself is highly radioactive, so no human habitation is, or will ever be, possible. However, some of the heavy elements of the planet are quite valuable, and so Aillis offers a fair living for those who don't shun heavy, dangerous labor.</description>
   <bar>Though this bar is not exactly inhospitable, it also doesn't make you feel very welcome. Running costs are kept low, which means maintenance and service suffer. Nevertheless, it's quite possible to have a good time here.</bar>

   <description>Ambre was one of the planets that played a key role in the workers' revolts that eventually led to the establishment of House Dvaered. In those days, the planet was home to a considerable percentage of the Imperial workforce in this sector of space. Without laborers to work the mines and construction yards, the Empire stood to lose astronomical amounts of money each cycle. This was an important reason for the Emperor to grant House Dvaered its independence.</description>
   <bar>Ambre's spaceport bar is never quiet. At regular intervals, all other noise in the bar is drowned out by the sound of cargo pods trundling across the railway just below. This is because the bar was built relatively late in the planet's development, as the Imperial government didn't see the need for one when Ambre was still little more than a labor camp. As a result, the bar had to be squeezed into one the only remaining space available, which was right over the freight lines.</bar>

   <description>Ammu is a generally calm planet, once one is accustomed to the constant rumbling of the lava flows. Lava eruptions are often felt in the subterranean spaceport, but the way it doesn't seem to faze the locals reassures you.</description>
   <bar>The Ammu Spaceport Bar, known as "The Heatsink" due to its frigid temperatures, in contrast to the rest of the station. While primarily known for their temperature, that's not to say they can't whip up a mean Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.</bar>

   <description>Anecu is a completely aquatic planet. Its surface is covered completely by water. In the shallow areas great underwater cities are constructed, as the climate above the water can be very harsh (waves been recorded to be up to 2 kilometres high). The planet boasts extensive ship-designing facilities, using the high-pressure of the water as a benchmark against which ships are measured.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is approximately 3 kilometres below the surface of the planet. The walls are constructed from a hardened, transparent polymer that allows you to see into the darkness of the water. Every so often you can see gelatinous creatures sliding around, barely illuminated by the bar lighting.</bar>

   <description>Named after the Egyptian god of death, Anubis was established as a mining base by a mining faction even before the Faction Wars. The abundance of radioactive and heavy elements made the planet a good location to produce weapons, a lucrative business given its proximity to Sol. During the Faction Wars, Anubis was annexed by the Empire, but the local population subsequently joined the protest movement that eventually led to the establishment of House Dvaered. Today, the Dvaered use Anubis to produce ammunition and light combat ships to supply Raelid Outpost.</description>
   <bar>What is beautiful is often dangerous, but sometimes it also works the other way around. The spaceport bar on Anubis has a view over a ravine in the planet's surface, and the radioactive storms that frequently rage through it are quite a sight to behold. It is only offworlders who appreciate it, though, as most locals know how unpleasant it is to have to work in conditions like that.</bar>

   <description>Anya is the twin planet to Sabe, orbiting around their shared center of gravity in tandem. Anya is shrouded in permanent cloud cover of ash and snow however as a result of geological activity. A small number of Thurions live on the surface of Anya, but no large scale colonization effort has commenced as of yet, despite the planet's proximity to Sabe, the Thurian capital world. This is due at least in part to the geological instabilities of the planet.</description>

   <description>With nine billion inhabitants, Arck is one of the most densely populated worlds in the galaxy. Most of the planet's surface is covered by a gigantic, sprawling city. Naturally, with so much inhabitation comes massive environmental pollution, and many skeptics believe that what the Dvaered are doing here is a form of reverse terraforming - an attempt to turn Arck into an X class planet.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport on Arck is located right in the middle of a particularly densely populated urban center. The associated spaceport bar has been expanded and turned into a general leisure facility for the local inhabitants, something that often irritates traders who come here to do business, only to find themselves in the middle of a Dvaered Turborave party.</bar>

   <description>Arcturus Gamma is the Empire's first line of defense when it comes to their core systems. Piracy is nearly non-existent in the core systems due to the large standing force stationed here, and their routine patrols.</description>
   <bar>A truly utilitarian place, the Arcturus Gamma bar is metallic grey, meticulously maintained, and full of off-duty Empire soldiers.</bar>

   <description>Arrakis is a desert planet with no natural precipitation. The locals are continuously discussing sandworms, though you're not sure what to make of it.</description>
   <bar>The Arrakeen canteen is one of the shadier bars in Empire space. Lying on the border of the Empire, few patrols come through, and many scoundrels and mercenaries can be found plying their trade. The spice must flow, they said. It may not, but at least the rum does.</bar>

The atmosphere is toxic and the surface unstable, but the Soromid have managed to tame this world. Of course even they need to live in sheltered habitats, but in spite of that the population is thriving and the economy is stable. By all means, Arrentil is an example of Soromid persistence.</description>

   <description>Atalanta is named directly after the colony ship that settled it, Atalanta. Though the planet is too cold to be of any real value, the population is making a decent enough living thanks to the caches of heavy elements trapped under the ice.</description>
   <bar>Like all structures on the planet Atalanta's bar is built under the ice, but it is quite close to the surface. This is because a spectacular lighting effect can be observed overhead when the sun shines directly on the ice. Atalanta's orbit makes this a rare occurrence, but the bar's profits soar during every cycle.</bar>

   <description>Avoss was originally a mediocre, but habitable world. So, when the fourteenth colony ship, Petrovsk, arrived, its colonists considered themselved fairly fortunate to have found a place they could call home. However, some fifty years after the expedition had touched down, the world began to change. Seismic activity becan escalating off the charts everywhere, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions all over the world. Now, the world is devastated, a mere shadow of its former self. The colonists have managed to survive however, and remain even today.</description>

   <description>Beene is rich in all sorts of common minerals, so the Soromid are using this world the same way anyone would: as a source of raw materials. The elements mined here are processed into standard packages used by the Soromid bioships, which means Beene is quite an important strategic location for the Soromid fleet.</description>
   <bar>Pilots are advised to wear air-sealed suits when visiting Beene's bar. The planet's atmosphere can cause serious problems for normal humans, and the Soromid haven't bothered installing decontamination filters for the local population. As such, having a drink in Beene's bar is a bit of an ordeal. It's one of the less popular places among traders.</bar>

   <description>Bon Sebb is a mysterious place. Objects from all over the galaxy have a habit of turning up here. In fact, a large area of the planet's surface is a gigantic junk yard, known as the "Junkle", where the locals "hunt" for useful equipment they can sell to each other, or to passing travelers.</description>
   <bar>The bar on Bon Sebb is built out of things scavenged from the Junkle. The walls and furniture are all patchworks of various designs and materials. The only somewhat symmetrical feature of the bar is a holoportrait of the Creator of the Universe, hanging over the lopsided bar.</bar>

   <description>Brooks is a bustling, highly populated Imperial civilian planet. With the decline of the Empire, it has found itself on the border with dangerous space, a rather uncomfortable position. As Brooks is a rich planet with a lot of economical and political weight within the Empire, the Imperial Navy protects Arcturus for Brooks' sake as much as for the Imperial core systems.</description>
   <bar>On Brooks, everything is expensive, something that comes with most economically booming worlds. However, most traders put up with the inflated prices for refreshments and services at the spaceport bar, because Brooks is a place where profit is made.</bar>

   <description>The surface of the planet is predominantly covered with water and the planetary climate is characterized by abundant precipitation and strong winds, though sufficiently tolerable to make costly weather modification equipment unnecessary. Habitable land is often characterized by soft meadows, swamps and dense forests. The resource base of Caladan consists mainly of agriculture and biomass, with the locally bred and grown pundi rice being its main export, and fishing a traditional source of sustenance for its people. Other traditional products include wine and various livestock, most prominently cattle. Cuisine on Caladan is rather refined, with most dishes containing meat.</description>
   <bar>The bar is just off the starport with a great view of the harbor. You could watch the fishermen run frantically about attending their duties for hours.</bar>

   <description>Named after the guardian dog of hell for its role in monitoring and observing the immense Sol nebula. It was created shortly after the nebula stabilized. Exact details are confidential and there's more than enough military influence to make it suspicious. With all the conspiracy theories around the Incident, one can never be too sure where reality ends and fiction starts.</description>
   <bar>The bar is maintained by off-duty scientists and soldiers. It's rather small and has a minuscule selection of beverages. There's little ambient noise; it seems as though boredom has gotten the best of most personnel.</bar>

   <description>Cetrat is an aquatic planet known for its medical algae. No one has been able to reproduce it exactly as it is in the wild, but with the abundance of it throughout the planet's massive ocean, there has been little effort in that field. Cetrat was colonized by the eighth colony ship launched during the First Growth, Brooklyn.</description>
   <bar>The bar is very large, and yet has fairly few patrons. You notice the drink list has a "living" menu. When you ask the bartender about them, he says they specialize in drinks containing living creatures. Generally jellyfish, but sometimes small cephalopods, or more exotic beings. As exotic cultures go, Cetrat is among the stranger.</bar>

   <description>Chriik is a dead world. Like most desert planets it has no bodies of water and a hot climate, but unlike most desert planets, it doesn't have any indigenous life whatsoever. Indeed, there is no reason why anyone or anything would want to live here in the first place. This makes it a perfect planet for major industries to set up shop, since they can pollute all they want without repercussions.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is a popular place on Chriik, because even inside the habitation complexes the air is so dry it will parch you out in record time.</bar>

   <description>Crylo is an oceanic world with very little land surface, but it sports a surprising number of inhabitants. As it happens, the aquatic life found on this world is considered a delicacy in large parts of the galaxy, which has both attracted people to settle on the planet and spawned a flourishing fishing industry.</description>
   <bar>Fishing is the name of the game on Crylo, and the spaceport bar is nothing if not in character. Almost everything in here is fish-themed, including the bar, which has been made out of the spine of some gargantuan aquatic creature.</bar>

   <description>Culex is the moon of planet Myonei. Myonei itself is a factory world, but it's too unpleasant for even the geneticlaly altered Soromid to live on. Fortunately, Culex is quite suitable for inhabitation, and so the workers who labor on the surface have their homes here. Culex is little more than a habitat, with no economy of its own. It's fairly uninteresting to most people who don't actually live there.</description>
   <bar>As Culex sees little traffic other than the forensic kind, the spaceport bar has been repurposed as a community centre for the locals. The standard facilities are still present and operational, but in a minimal fashion. Most of the facility is filled with recreational facilities and even a dance floor.</bar>

   <description>Cutha is a marvel of planetary engineering. It started out as a fairly hostile world, its atmosphere filled with toxic substances, but the Soromid have tamed it and turned it into a pretty decent place to live. Of course, even Soromid engineering has its limits, so Cutha isn't quite as nice a world as Turawee in Sarcophagus, but the result is still impressive. Nowadays, Cutha houses most of the Soromid involved in the military operations at Heronus.</description>
   <bar>Cutha's bar is very close to being an open-air bar. The airspace is still fully enclosed, but most of the surfaces that aren't the actual floor are transparent. The ceiling in particular is made of a material that's all but invisible to the naked eye, and with the artificial breeze that blows through the bar it's very easy to believe the illusion that one is actually outside. Only on rainy days is the effect spoiled.</bar>

   <description>Even before House Dvaered gained its independence, there were unofficial news channels that fueled the discontent among the Imperial labor force. Later, after their work was done, these channels pooled their resources to establish the Dvaered News Network, or DVNN. This station serves as the main nexus for all Dvaered mass media. As such it is coveted by many a Warlord, but Dvaered High Command makes sure that the station remains firmly under its control.</description>
   <bar>Spaceport bar, waiting lounge, interview room, this facility is everything at once. It's the only place accessible to non-DVNN personnel, so all dealings with visitors have to take place here. In fact, one of the Dvaered reality shows is a live feed from the spaceport bar on DVNN Central, showing how the various visitors behave. The Dvaered seem to find this entertaining.</bar>

   <description>When the Soromid claimed the barren world of Hadosh I, they had the privilege of naming it and its moon. The planet came to be known as Daahrax. However, in an impressive display of bureaucratic indecision, the planet's moon remains unnamed. There is constant debate in the various governmental institutions, and time and again naming commissions are created whose suggestions are promptly rejected. It doesn't seem the Soromid are going to come up with a good name anytime soon.</description>
   <bar>Hello, traveler, welcome to the Daahrax spaceport bar. A word of advice, don't ask about the moon. Trust me, don't do it. The locals are a little touchy on the subject. How about a drink instead?</bar>

   <description>The small moon orbiting Rhu IV named Daal is easily overlooked, but as it happens it is quite an important piece of real estate for the Sirii. The people who live here are particularly zealous in their beliefs, and most of them end up serving a lifetime in the Sirius army. The Fyrra are especially well represented on this world.</description>
   <bar>On Daal, people like to be reminded that they are part of a large galactic faction. The tables in this spaceport bar have low-tech displays incorporated in their surfaces, and each table displays one of the Sirian worlds, as well as up-to-date information about that world. Naturally, Mutris is displayed on the largest table, but Daal itself makes a good second.</bar>

   <description>Renowned for its outfit market and shipyards. Almost the entire Darkshed station is dedicated to trading outfits and ships. Mercenaries and bounty hunters from all over the galaxy come here to see try newest enhancements available on the market. This tends to also attract many of the shadier characters in the universe, winding up with frequent fights where they test their newly bought outfits.</description>
   <bar>The Darkshed canteen is decorated with all sorts of odd artifacts that chronicle trends in spaceship outfitting in the years since the station was established. Scale models of many popular ships hang from the ceiling.</bar>

   <description>Gilligan's Light was one of the first systems to ever be chosen for a colonization project, and Dawn was the first world on which humans set foot in this sector of space, despite the fact that the colony ship sent here, Mythril, was only the fifth to be launched. Nevertheless, Dawn proved to be one of the most fertile expeditions in the First Growth, and its development outstripped that of most of the other worlds. With the advent of hyperspace travel, Dawn found itself the local capital of the Frontier worlds, and so is graced by the Frontier Council hanging overhead. This status is strictly symbolic, but it explains why the FLF have chosen to rally around Gilligan's Light.</description>
   <bar>Dawn's bar has a rustic feel to it, as the locals have made a point of keeping the style close to what was the prevalent design in the early expansion era. Other than that, this bar doesn't have much to set it apart from others. The noise, the smell and the drunks are features that are commonplace throughout the galaxy.</bar>

   <description>Diabolos station was constructed especially for the sport that made Totoran famous. The station sports two separate arenas. The first one is a deadly, three dimensional labyrinth filled with dangerous traps and obstacles. It fills most of the station's bulk. The second arena is actually space itself. Gladiators fight in lifesuits on the outer hull of the station, without lifelines.</description>

   <description>Despite not officially classifying as habitable, the Dvaered have settled on Donnar in sufficient numbers to give the planet the status of civilian world. Though the soil is barely fertile and the atmosphere is less than pleasant for even the most hardy plant life, Donnar has the major advantage of having almost no seismic activity at all. And as many a colony prospector can tell you, a stable planet is a good planet.</description>
   <bar>Donnar has something unusual to offer to offworlders. The spaceport bar is constructed like an arena, with the spectator area fulfilling the functions that most other spaceport bars do, and the central area serving as the stage for entertainment of all kinds, ranging from fights to displays of art. The concept is rather ingenious, and many a spacer is as astonished at the display as they are at the fact that the Dvaered came up with this idea.</bar>

   <description>Doranthex Prime is a mostly-molten planet. One of the few pieces of solid land, a small island drifts around the northern polar region. On this island the Dvaered have established a small base, primarily for research and military prototyping, though civilians are allowed in the main facilities. Due to the intense temperatures, the base is shielded by over 50m of temperature isolation plating, which affords no view of the planet itself once a ship has landed.</description>
   <bar>The drinks served in the Furnace, as the bar calls itself, are a rather curious sort. They are generally very strong and served at a warm temperature. The house specialties also contain volcanic ash which is harvested on the planet surface. A strange bar indeed.</bar>

   <description>Dowue is a planet known for the infamous "Dowue Syndrome", a condition where patients will temporarily go insane with hysteria due to prolonged expose of certain visual wavelengths. This was at first attributed a contaminated shipment of food, but later it was found that the sun in the Apez system emitted abnormal wavelengths, whose effects where multiplied by contaminants in Dowue's atmosphere. Shortly thereafter, it became mandatory for all personnel to wear special goggles designed to filter out the harmful light.</description>
   <bar>The Dowue Spaceport Bar is better known as the Frozen Shrimp after some ancient crustaceans found during the construction of the spaceport. It is a place where most of the personnel spend their time. The dangers, even with protective goggles, of the Dowue Syndrome persuade most people to stay indoors, and the bar lies in the heart of the spaceport.</bar>

   <description>Draconis Epsilon is a densely populated Imperial world. It grew rich in the days before the Incident, when Draconis was still a core system, not at the outer fringes of Imperial controlled territory. The inhabitants here have suffered from the change, but not as much as you might expect. The world maintains a solid consumer base.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar on Draconis Epsilon is circular in shape, with exits all around leading to the various spaceport platforms. The place is gigantic, providing seats for up to ten thousand customers at the same time, and more at the bar. Most spacers who have visited Epsilon Draconis agree that few spaceport bars are quite as impressive as this one.</bar>

   <description>Draconis Omega was one of the old Empire's best colonies. The planet is large compared to Earth, yet its gravity is comparable. This made it ideal as a population base, which it remains today. Draconis Omega remains firmly loyal to the Empire despite its now isolated position. The people here believe that the after effects of the Incident are only temporary, and that the Empire will one day regain its former glory, in which Draconis Omega will feature prominently.</description>
   <bar>Ever the optimists, the people of Draconis Omega have decorated their spaceport bar with displays of past Imperial power, portraits of former Emperors and charts that show the size of the Empire when it was at its peak. It's clear that the inhabitants truly believe that the good times will one day return.</bar>

   <description>Durea is not a terribly pleasant place to live, as it orbits its star a little too distantly for comfort, which leaves most of the planet covered in snow and ice. Only a small portion of the surface thaws far enough in summer for the mining operations, but despite that the riches underneath the crust compel the hardy population to dig. Indeed, if one day resources in the galaxy grow sparse enough, Durea may well find itself in an economically superior position.</description>
   <bar>This bar is the standard-issue model that can be found on unpopular mining colonies throughout the galaxy. It's essentially a regular prefab habitation unit converted to a bar. It has all the amenities and features you might expect in a public facility, but it offers none of the comfort that bars on metropolis planets tend to sport. The liquor served here is often pretty strong, which is in no small part due to the planet's harsh environment.</bar>

   <description>While Durumdra technically classifies as a P class ice world, the place can be quite comfortable to live. Some regions near the equator melt during part of the planet's solar cycle, and during this period there is an outburst of life, ranging from vegetation to small hibernating animals. By Dvaered standards, the planet is not so bad at all.</description>
   <bar>Durumdra doesn't have much to distinguish itself by in the galaxy, but the spaceport bar comes a long way. It has drinks from all over the galaxy, though Draygar's awkward location means that most of them are rather pricey. Nevertheless, Durumdra has earned itself a footnote in several noted galactic tourist guides.</bar>

   <description>Dvaer Prime is the capital world in Dvaered space. It was the world on which the Old Empire granted House Dvaered its status as a Great House, and the Dvaered chose to name their people after it. However, iconic though the planet may be, it is of little actual consequence. At best it is fought over jealously by the Dvaered Warlords, who consider ownership of the world a matter of great prestige, but otherwise there is nothing that sets Dvaer Prime apart from other planets. After all, the decisions are all made in Dvaered High Command, which floats in high orbit over Dvaer Prime.</description>
   <bar>Dvaer Prime sports a well appointed spaceport bar. It is not so much luxurious as it is grimy, but at least all necessary facilities are present and in working order, and the drinks are decent enough by Dvaered standards. A holopainting on the wall commemorates the inauguration ceremony for House Dvaered, but it is faded and warped in places, a testament to the fact that most Dvaered citizens have long ago forgotten that they are technically still part of the Empire.</bar>

   <description>This is Dvaered High Command, the true seat of power over all Dvaered controlled territories. It is here that the Dvaered Generals come together and decide on a course of action for the Dvaered military forces. Understandably, Dvaered High Command is a military stronghold, one of the most heavily guarded places in the galaxy. One needs a certain amount of Dvaered commendations to even be allowed to set foot on the station.</description>

   <description>A small moon orbiting Sarcophagus II, Ebenezer's atmosphere is deadly to humand and Soromid alike. However, the Soromid found out that their biological ships quite like it here, and a few weeks of continued exposure makes the outer skin tougher and more resistant to damage. Most Soromid military ships will make a visit to Ebenezer early on in their lives for this reason.</description>
   <bar>There's really not too much to to on Ebenezer. The Soromid who live here permanently are here to oversee the ships tethered to the surface, and their population isn't large enough to present much of a market. Traders don't often come to this place.</bar>

   <description>Eclipse Station is the major military outpost in this area of Dvaered space. It serves as a customs checkpoint for Imperial and Consortium traders looking to travel to Dvaer and beyond. Simultaneously, it is charged with minimizing the Pirate threat in this region of space. It therefore comes as no surprise that Eclipse Station stations a sizeable fleet.</description>
   <bar>This bar is clearly not a place for relaxation. It is frequented mostly by traders who are waiting for their shipments to clear. The appointments are drab and functional, and the smell of cleaning chemicals is prevalent.</bar>

The population here is spread out over many small or medium sized islands scattered evenly across the globe. The Sirius governemt has divided up the land between the three echelons, with each island predominantly inhabited by either Shaira, Fyrra or Serra.</description>

   <description>Deep within Empire space, Em 5 is a quiet world. Few would have ranked it highly in the spectrum of galactic politics, yet after the Incident, it gained notability when it became a temporary refuge of the Emperor. In the time since, it's become a popular place for the aristocracy to meet.</description>
   <bar>The Drunken Lobster has a plaque commemorating the time the Emperor spent on Em 5. It seems unlikely he ever visited this bar, though, given its less than refined patrons and threadbare furniture.</bar>

   <description>Ember, like its primary Forge, is a hot world. Its surface is molten in places, its atmosphere will burn an unprotected human to a crisp in seconds and seismic activity makes the planet a death trap even in a protected environment. Despite all this, the Sirii have established a sizeable industry on Forge's moon. Located on a relatively stable plate, this complex collects the rare materials produced by Ember's volcanic activity and turns them into raw materials for ship building. The business is quite lucrative, supplying a significant portion of all materials for Sirius' ships.</description>
   <bar>Ember's spaceport bar is frequented by workers from the industrial complex, most of them from the Shaira echelon. They have many tales to tell of the dangers of their job and the brutal nature of Ember's weather. None of them seem to be discontent with their lives, though.</bar>

It's a massive project that is attempting to completely transform a C-class world into that which is suitable for the highest ranks of the Empire's aristocracy. Currently it possesses few amenities beyond the Starport.</description>

   <description>Europea is almost completely covered in water, which was considered undesirable in the early days of the First Growth. However, it was soon discovered that Europea's biosphere contained many organisms that were useful in the production of high-grade medicine, and an exception was made. This means that Europea is one of the earliest O-class planets that were ever colonized. Today, the world still thrives on its medical exports, though advances in medicinal technology since the days of the First Growth have rendered a considerable portion of it obsolete.</description>
   <bar>Perhaps uniquely in the galaxy, both the spaceport and its associated facilities are afloat without tethers. This means that the location of the spaceport itself changes over time as the platform is carried on the major currents that span the face of the planet.</bar>

   <description>Facett Outpost is little more than a local police station. It was created as a precaution against the pirate threat coming from Khaas, but the Soromid know that no one station could withstand a coordinated attack. Facett is mostly a visible sign of Soromid presence in Hatter. It puts the local population at peace. The real security has to come from Hartwell Station in neighbor system Father's Pride.</description>
   <bar>The bar is where the local security employees go when they're on standby. They seldom have to wait for a long time before their assistance is required.</bar>

   <description>Officially, Fernando Station is a local security nexus, meant to keep the local systems safe from pirates and the FLF. But it is rather heavily equipped for simply maintaining law and order. Some people believe that the Dvaered are gradually reinforcing Ogat, preparing for a military conflict with the Empire. Nothing currently suggests that the Dvaered are on the warpath, but Fernando Station might be a harbinger of things to come.</description>
   <bar>The spacedock bar is mainly frequented by Dvaered military pilots, as can be expected from a bar on a military base. The drinks served here are mostly free of mind-altering substances, a serious detractor to the ordinary visitor, but then Fernando station isn't out to make itself attractive.</bar>

   <description>Fuzka is a fairly typical Imperial civilian world. It has a good atmosphere, stable tectonics and a large population. The world grows most of its own food, but still needs imports to make ends meet. The local population is as well off as can be expected from a middle-class Imperial colony. Otherwise, there is little to note about Fuzka.</description>
   <bar>The bar caters to its clientele with considerable efficiency. Since Fuzka has quite a high amount of civilian traffic, its bar needs to handle the many passengers who are waiting for their transport to depart.</bar>

   <description>The Sirii have a rather extensive military infrastructure within their borders, and Fyruse Station is part of that infrastructure. There's a regular detachment stationed here, making sure that law and order are maintained as well as can reasonably be expected in Esker and its neighboring systems. Fyruse Station also acts as a border guard for Frontier space, though nobody really believes in the need for such.</description>
   <bar>As Fyruse Station is a Sirius-only facility, the bar is divided in three sections, one for each echelon. In the rare event that a non-Sirius visitor is allowed on board, they will be catered for in the Shaira section.</bar>

   <description>Soromid space is low on worlds suitable for agriculture, so the Soromid need to rely on alternative food production. Gaula, an aquatic planet, is one such alternative. Vast stretches of the ocean floor are taken up by enormous submarine farms where certain kinds of underwater flora are cultivated and harvested, to be processed into food by the factory station up above.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport and its accompanying support facilities are floating on a platform above one of the primary farms on Gaula. The water is strictly off-limits, and anyone foolish enough to dump waste into the ocean is harshly penalized.</bar>

   <description>Gaula Foods is the food factory that processes the produce grown on Gaula into human digestible meal units. The station outputs an amazing variety of foodstuffs considering the limited diversity of the plants they are made from.</description>
   <bar>The bar offers samples of most of the products made in the factory complex. The taste is generally not bad, although after a while it starts to get a little samey.</bar>

   <description>The colony on Gayathi has been around since before Sirichana settled on Mutris. In those days it was an outpost of one of the Factions that were destroyed in the Faction Wars, forgotten and overlooked by all. With its source of funding and supplies gone, Gayathi never had a chance to fully develop its economic infrastructure. Then, when Sirius rose as a galactic power, Gayathi came to fall under its influence. Now it is home to some of the most devout believers found in Sirius space.</description>

   <description>Geron was once an Imperial colony, but when House Goddard was established and granted full authority over the system, it also acquired jurisdiction over Geron. In the decades that followed the Imperial bureaucracy was largely dismantled and replaced by a more governorial arrangement. That improved the efficiency at which the world was run, but without its Imperial status the economy took a serious hit. Nowadays, Geron is a fairly average civilian world that houses the majority of Goddard's citizens.</description>
   <bar>Like many spaceport bars, this one is loud, crowded and a little smelly. In other words, it's a home away from home for those who make their living in space.</bar>

   <description>Wilibrord Gilligan was a famous explorer of space in the times of the Second Growth. He is responsible for charting many of the currently known jump routes, having a knack for spotting the areas in space that allowed entry into hyperspace for prolonged periods. In those days this was exceptional, since scanning technology was nowhere near as advanced as now. In honor of Gilligan's services to the old Factions, he was granted his own star system and settlement therein. After the Faction Wars, Gilligan's Memory came to fall under Sirian rule, though the Sirii have chosen to uphold Gilligan's memory.</description>
   <bar>Predictably, the spaceport bar is themed on Wilibrord Gilligan, showing his likeness in several places and displaying a map of his travels through the galaxy on the wall. A popular topic in this bar is the dwarf planets in Gilligan's Memory, particularly speculations on why Gilligan chose to name them the way he did.</bar>

   <description>Somewhat unusually in Dvaered space, Ginni is primarily a crop growing world. Though most Dvaered worlds trace their lineage to either mining or industrial roots, Ginni was a food producer even in the days when the Empire was still in control. Hoewever, with the change in political influence throughout the region, Ginni's government wisely chose to ally with the Dvaered movement.</description>
   <bar>A lot of planetside spaceport bars have windows that give visitors a glance of the immediate environment, but the one on Ginni does not. This is because the sunlight on Ginni can get rather intense, and it was cheaper to build a wall than an automatically adjusting viewport. Besides, there's not too much to see anyway.</bar>

   <description>Godtra is a reasonably balanced world, with a sizeable civilian population, a fair amount of heavy industry and some farming for internal consumption, though the population largely depends on Torg Crops for sustenance. As Godtra is one of the wealthiest Dvaered systems within a few jumps, it is a popular target for Warlords to conquer.</description>
   <bar>A pretty decent place as far as spaceport bars go, Godtra's bar is well equipped to facilitate traders and other offworlders. The data uplinks are decently speedy, which is rare on a Dvaered world. Clearly, the local infrastructure has been well designed.</bar>

   <description>Greis has a tradition, and that tradition is that whichever Warlord controls the planet renames it after himself. This often causes confusion among spacers everywhere, who will refer to the world by names that have been rendered obsolete. The current warlord is a man named Harmstadt Greis. His rule isn't particularly benevolent, but he at least doesn't seem worse than most Dvaered Warlords.</description>
   <bar>At the center of this spaceport bar stands a pillar, on which are displayed all the names that the planet has been known by, including the name of one unfortunate Warlord named Clerke, who was in control of this world for a little under four hours.</bar>

   <description>Haldr ranks quite high on the official list of "most unpleasant inhabited planets in the galaxy", which is compiled at regular intervals by the Gilligan Foundation. Indeed, even the most optimistic space traveler would be hard pressed to find a good reason why anyone would want to come to Haldr, let alone stay there. As it turns out, Dvaered High Command has such a reason: Haldr serves as a training grounds for Dvaered military recruits. Though many an upcoming soldier finds death on the radioactive surface of Haldr, those who survive make for tough fighters indeed.</description>
   <bar>To get into Haldr's bar, you first have to undergo a rigorous decontamination procedure, even when you're coming straight from the spaceport dock. This fact has made more than a few visitors so uneasy that they never want to visit Haldr again.</bar>

   <description>Before there was Emperor's Fist, before there was even the Incident, there was Halir, located in the Gamma Polaris system. While near the outskirts of the Empire, it served as one of the largest local civilian hubs, with a strong economy and considerable political influence. Then, one day, the new Emperor had Polaris Prime built, renamed most of the worlds in the system, and subsequently started the Emperor's Fist project. Halir was reduced to an economical support role. However, the local government has stubbornly clung on to the right to sovereignty, and so Halir remains a civilian world.</description>
   <bar>Halir's bar has everything the weary traveler could hope for, from drinks to data uplink terminals to per-table sound dampening fields and music generators. In short it is a luxurious place, which is largely due to Halir's long history of economic success. Anything you can't find in the bar you can find in the pleasure district, which is just a single tube station away.</bar>

   <description>Hankies is something of a holiday resort as well as retreat for the wealthy. It is mainly a consumer world, having neither the land for agriculture nor the resources for industry. It does, however, have a pleasant ecosystem and a wealth of beautiful geography.</description>
   <bar>Since Hankies doesn't have much to offer, the bar is almost entirely an import product. The architecture, the facilities and the drinks can all be traced offworld. The only thing that is truly authentic to this world is the view from the windows - a mountain range stretching away into the distance.</bar>

   <description>Father's Pride is an important junction in Soromid space, and it needs to be well secured. Hartwell Station does just that. Besides securing local traffic, it also sends patrols into neighbouring systems, particularly Shikima, as Soromid Wards Alpha is a vital asset to the Soromid economy.</description>
   <bar>It's typically only Soromid officers who frequent the recreational facilities on a military station. Regular Soromid sailors tend to stay with the ships, caring for them and making sure they are in good health.</bar>

   <description>Not exactly unhabitable and not exactly habitable, Hassak is one of those places where the less fortunate in society end up. The people here have it hard, with storms of almost every variety plagueing the landscape on a regular basis. The population feeds itself with the sale of raw minerals to the Nexus corporation, which buys well under the market price, because it can.</description>
   <bar>The bar on Hassak is a lousy affair. The planet is poor, and so can't afford any luxury, least of all for offworlders. The Empire has provided the world with basic facilities and equipment because it is bound to do so by intergalactic treaties, but most of it is old and run-down.</bar>

   <description>Heii is the rather unattractive moon of Juran. Juran itself is a natural M-class, so first time visitors often wonder why the Soromid chose to settle here and not down below. The reason is actually quite interesting. Juran is home to many amazing life forms, including large creatures not at all unlike the dinosaurs that once roamed ancient Earth. Settling down on Juran would not only be dangerous, it would also mean a disturbance in the natural ecosystem. Thus, the Soromid chose not to inhabit Juran, but instead tap its natural animal life by selling specimens as exotic pets throughout the galaxy.</description>
   <bar>Visitors to Heii spaceport bar can use special consoles to access video feeds from survey satellites deployed all around Juran, to observe the life forms on the surface and perhaps even pick one to take back to their own world.</bar>

   <description>The first Soromid bioships were grown on Sorom itself, and it was in those ships that the Soromid spread through the galaxy. But Sorom is no more. Nowadays, most Soromid ships are grown here, on Heronus. The planet's gravitic and atmospheric properties make it ideal for raising ships in all kinds of sizes and shapes. A carrier class vessel can reach maturity in as few as four SCU.</description>

   <description>Heronus Orbital is a military base directly tied to Heronus below. Its primary duty is to protect the planet, because it is vital to the Soromid fleet. If Heronus were to cease producing new ships, the Soromid would suffer a tremendous blow to their military capabilities. Needless to say, Heronus Orbital is one of the most heavily armed stations in Soromid space.</description>
   <bar>A large viewport gives a magnificent view of the young ships that occasionally lift off from Heronus. There's something about the sheen of a ship that has not yet undergone treatment at Ebenezer that particularly catches the eye.</bar>

INSS-2 has allowed them to grow.</description>

   <description>Somehwat curiously, Imperial Nutrient Supply Station 3 is actually owned by House Dvaered. Though initially constructed by the Empire, the station was ceded to House Dvaered as part of its official inception. INSS-3 still provides food for the Imperial colonies at Tau Prime and Draconis, though the price of food there has gone up by a fair margin ever since the change in ownership.</description>
   <bar>The bar is not much to speak of. The Dvaered have shown a greater interest in farming than in public relations, so the spaceport bar has been largely neglected. It's a wonder the basic facilities are even functional at all.</bar>

   <description>Inios Station is something like a border guard between Sirius and Dvaered controlled territories. Though officially not a military complex, Inios does garrison far more combat capable ships that one might expect of a commercial station. Whenever the Dvaered send in skirmish fleets to try the Sirius defenses, it is Inios Station that sends them on their way home.</description>
   <bar>The bar is built against an outer wall. Several large windows allow patrons to look out on the frozen wastes of Eye of Night III, the planet around which the station orbits. Not coincidentally, the windows also allow people to see the Sirius armed forces docking and taking off, emphasizing the military capacity of the station.</bar>

   <description>Jaan is one of the most densely populated planets in this corner of the galaxy. The world benefits greatly from nearby Nexus operations, which makes it a popular place to live despite the environmental issues that inevitably come with a large population, and the problems with security that have arisen in recent years.</description>
   <bar>Jaan has a big spaceport, and to facilitate the many pilots and crews that pass through it has multiple spaceport bars. Each spaceport bar is exactly the same as all the others, though. Not even the people who frequently visit Jaan can tell them apart. This regularly causes problems for unsuspecting people who promised to meet at the spaceport bar.</bar>

   <description>There can almost be no greater contrast than there is between Jaegnhild and its primary, Uuries. One is an ocean world, filled with all kinds of unlikely forms of life, while the other is a lifeless chunk of coalesced dust. Jaegnhild was one of the last colonies established in the First Growth, but among all the chosen worlds it was perhaps the most suitable to life when the colony ship arrived. Though not many call the floating cities their home, the standard of living is unusually high for a Frontier world.</description>
   <bar>Jaegnhild's bar is built into an ancient compartiment of the colony ship Pristine, which brought the first human settlers to this world so many years ago. Though most of the structure has been rebuilt using newer materials, the original plating can still be seen in places.</bar>

   <description>Jorcan is a very barren, dull planet, like most mining worlds. Having been mined for decades, its resources have been nearly exhausted. However, mining corporations are known to persist until there's no longer a profit to be made, leaving depleted, dead planets.</description>
   <bar>The one word that would describe the Jorcan spaceport bar would be dust. It's everywhere: on the seats, on the counter, in the drinks, on everyone's faces. A coarse soot has coated your palm just holding your drink. You wonder if it will ever wash off.</bar>

   <description>Jorlan is one of the least successful Frontier worlds. Its colony ship, Santa Maria, arrived to find a barren, desolate rock that had next to no potential for human inhabitants. But with the only other reachable planet being a gas giant, Santa Maria's captain was faced with the choice to settle or perish. Somehow, his expedition has managed to eke out an existence on Jorlan.
Jorlan's inhabitants are mostly part of the ore refining process, as it supplies most of the Frontier with all sorts of alloys. Gas miners are also sent to Haleb IV every dozen STP when the climate conditions are favorable.</description>
   <bar>Rather out of character for a heavy-industry world, the people of Jorlan people don't really have a habit of drinking. You see numerous other spacefarers, but no natives.</bar>

   <description>With the loss of Sorom, the Soromid had to decide on a new political capital. After some debate, it was decided that Kataka would fill this position. Kataka is by no means a pleasant world, but the Soromid being the Soromid, that made no difference. Present day, Kataka is home to most if not all of the influential Soromid citizens. Authorities on all aspects of Soromid can be found here.</description>
   <bar>It's quite unusual for a non-Soromid to be granted landing rights on Kataka. And even when this happens, offworlders are usually restricted to the spaceport facility, and if they have business with planetside officials then those officials come to them. The spaceport bar is built for such occurrences, providing private booths where people may converse in private.</bar>

   <description>Khelim was the target world for Majestic, the eleventh colony ship sent from Earth in the First Growth. Majestic was populated chiefly by people from India and the Middle East, and though interstellar traffic has been commonplace for many years now, the characteristic features of that area can still be seen on the faces of the people of Khelim.</description>
   <bar>The Crescent Blade bar is about as respectable as low-profile bars come. It has all the standard facilities the galactic traveler has come to rely on, and the service leaves nothing to be desired. Other than that, the place is unremarkable.</bar>

   <description>Laarss is a resource world. Before the inception of House Dvaered, it used to supply the Imperial economy with raw materials at bottom prices. Nowadays, its chief export market is Eist Shipyard, which is in constant need of ship building resources. Though Laarss is largely the same mining colony it was before, working here is considered something of a privilege among Dvaered citizens, considering its location in Dvaer.</description>
   <bar>Though technically this place is the spaceport bar, its main function is a place of leisure for the local population. At all times, you can find large groups of Dvaered workers here, spending their off-time and their credits on booze and entertainment.</bar>

   <description>Though Coriolis was the second colony ship, it arrived at Lapra well after New Dortmund had been colonized due to technical difficulties and unforeseen incidents during the journey. When it finally did establish orbit around Lapra, it found a world so low on potential for life that the trip almost seemed like a lost cause. However, upon touchdown the colonists found that there were many useful minerals hidden below the surface of the planet. The colony on Lapra has survived, first out of sheer necessity and later by virtue of its exports.</description>
   <bar>Lapra's bar looks more like a market than a place for relaxation, and indeed that is exactly what it is. Not only do traders come here to make transactions, the local population also uses the bar as a center for commerce. That said, one can still find a drink and a news terminal, if one looks hard enough.</bar>

   <description>Larling is a popular world for businesses and industries to settle. Sergio Vix is located close to a number of important Soromid systems, and the price of real estate on Larling is low. In addition, the world has quite relaxed environmental legislation, which means industries can cut on emission reduction costs.</description>
   <bar>You won't find Larling's spaceport bar in any top 100 list, but that doesn't mean it's bad. There's just nothing particularly exceptional about it.</bar>

   <description>Churchill's economic position has turned Lorelei into a well developed world. The constant trade revenues have allowed for large habitation complexes and underground factories that wouldn't look out of place on a Dvaered industrial world. However, unlike the Dvaered, the Sirii have put some thought into their infrastructure, and pollution is kept to a minimum.</description>
   <bar>Because the Sirii didn't want to waste space on a full-fledged spaceport bar, the bar on Lorelei is a virtual one. Visitors enter a VR booth and are given the illusion of being in a large, luxurious spaceport bar, where they can interact with other visitors and the uplink avatars. It is even possible to consume beverages in the virtual bar, as the VR booth is capable of stimulating the part of the human brain that deals with food and drink.</bar>

   <description>M.K, a rather oddly named planet, holds a special place in many Soromid's hearts. It is the closest inhabited world to Sorom that survived the Incident. It has little else to set it apart, however. The local economy is operating along predictable lines, and the population is no better off than on most Soromid worlds. To most traders, M.K. is just another market to make profit in.</description>
   <bar>Both Soromid and non-Soromid frequent this spaceport bar. As Wildwood station is more of a service utility than a real community, M.K. is often the first real Soromid port most new traders visit. It is therefore here they get their first taste of a full-fledged Soromid society. It's not uncommon to find yound pilots looking at the surroundings with a mixture of wonder and nervousness.</bar>

   <description>In a strange twist of fate, Madeleine station was named after the granddaughter of the first commander to be stationed here. The place serves as the Empire's southernmost military base. It was originally little more than a minor depot, but has grown into an important line of defense against the southern pirates in recent years.</description>
   <bar>Since traders don't come to this military base, the bar is only frequented by Imperial military personnel. It's more like a canteen than a bar, really.</bar>

   <description>Madria is one of the few immigration worlds in Sirius space. Colonists from the Frontier constantly trickle into Esker, and they all end up here. The new arrivals are immediately converted and incorporated into the Shaira echelon, which is why that group is over-represented on this world. Only after several cycles of life on Madria do the immigrants get permission to move to other Sirius worlds or serve in the Sirius military.</description>
   <bar>There are two spaceport bars on Madria, one for regular visitors and one for immigrants. The one for immigrants is more or less a portal into Sirius society - a one way portal. Normal spacers stay away from it.</bar>

   <description>Manis is a cool world, though it still counts as earthlike. Unlike many other class M planets in the galaxy, no terraforming was ever performed here, so the world has almost the same ecosystem it did when it was first settled during the Second Growth. Many people are attracted to this "authentic" feel of the planet, which accounts for a significant portion of its popularity.</description>
   <bar>Perhaps uniquely in the entire galaxy, Manis' spaceport bar doesn't serve alcohol. It has any amount of sodas and herbal teas available, but they don't seem as effective at attracting customers to the bar as would your ordinary spacer's swill.</bar>

   <description>Mannannan is one of the more frequently visited Dvaered worlds. Uncharacteristically for a Dvaered planet, its political policies and its economy have remained fairly stable, since none of the Warlords controlling the planet have ever bothered to change the local laws in major ways. This has made Mannannan a favorable place to trade for foreigners. Of course, the Dvaered Warlords seem to be oblivious of this, so Mannannan will likely continue to be a unicum.</description>
   <bar>This bar is one of many. The increase in trade has also brought an increase in tastes, so there are several places that cater to particular tastes, even some very unsavory ones. Fortunately, the most accessible bar seems to be as respectable as bars come.</bar>

   <description>Manuel Station is named after Eduard Manuel Goddard, the man to which House Goddard owes its existence. The station is primarily a shipyard, and thus contributes a great deal to House Goddard's local economy. Its position around Goddard III is no coincidence, as the lifeless planet provides many of the raw materials needed to produce space ships.</description>
   <bar>The station's bar is more businesslike than recreative. The people who come here are either traders who came to load or unload goods, or potential customers looking for a Goddard-made ship. Nobody is really interested in just passing the time, because time is money on Manuel Station.</bar>

   <description>Marius Station used to be a customs station of the old Empire, checking traffic bound for Sol and the core Imperial systems. Now, in the post-Incident era, the station serves as the first line of defense from hostile elements that threaten the isolated colonies at Tau Prime and beyond. But since it is perpetually under-staffed and under-equipped, Marius Station is barely capable of maintaining its own presence in Raelid, let alone protect anything else.</description>
   <bar>This bar is self-service most of the time. All Empire personnel on board have their hands full with double shifts, repair duties and briefings. Few have the spare time to even visit the spacedock bar, let alone staff it.</bar>

   <description>The Frontier is relatively poor, and part of the reason for this is that the Frontier is lacking in energy output. In an attempt to reinforce this weak link, the Frontier Council sanctioned the construction of a deep space power generator, whish was to provide energy cells to industries across Frontier space. That generator is Megan Station.</description>
   <bar>The spacedock bar is quite plain in its appointments. The Frontier people have learned to be practical and utilitarian, and so didn't waste any more space or effort on the bar onboard Megan than was required.</bar>

   <description>This is the headquarters of all spaceborne Soromid military operations. It was dedicated in memory of the Soromid's original homeworld, Sorom. Though the Incident happened many SCU ago and most Soromid are too young to remember their planet of origin, the emotional attachment is shared among young and old alike.</description>
   <bar>The spacedock bar, if you can even call it that, is just a modest section of a larger facility that's used for all sorts of military-to-civilian business, such as recruitment procedures. The place is always busy. Memory of Sorom is not a place for anyone to relax.</bar>

   <description>Modus is an unstable world, but it is surprisingly well populated. Something about the planet is greatly beneficial to human fertility, which makes it a popular destination for couples trying to conceive a child the natural way. Of course this is not without risk, as the planet's volatile nature claims a considerable number of lives each cycle.</description>
   <bar>This bar has chosen to constantly play a heavy beat music track. This is not because people like heavy beat music, but rather to mask the tremors the planet's unstable crust sometimes creates.</bar>

   <description>Mouddar is a bit of a leisure resort, in all but name. While the planet does have a resident population, most of its income is from tourism. The planet is speckled with tiny coral peninsulae, which are prefect for all kinds of water sports. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of the Imperial adolescents who come here has had a detrimental effect on the environment.</description>
   <bar>Nobody really cares about Mouddar's spaceport bar, apart from the traders who only stop here to load and unload. Most civilian visitors, though, immediately head for the sun, sand and surf that they came here to enjoy.</bar>

   <description>Mutris. The very heart of Sirius space. This is where Crater City is to be found, home of Sirichana and the many Sirii pilgrims who will one day become the Touched. Crater City being the most holy of places, the airspace in a wide area around it is closed. The spaceport is located thousands of kilometers away. All approaches happen under a tight escort, and non-Sirii are confined to the commercial district of the planet's political capital.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is the primary meeting place for offworlders on Mutris. Since only Sirii may venture beyond the commercial district, all others are either conducting business or relaxing here. As far as bars go, Mutris' is a fairly accomodating one, though the various religious references make it somewhat uncomfortable to some.</bar>

   <description>Myonei is an industry planet supplying many of the surrounding Soromid worlds with basic necessities. The atmosphere is so dense that it can actually be tapped for raw materials. Most of the infrastructure on the planet is dedicated to the industry, with all of the permanent workforce living up on the moon of Culex.</description>
   <bar>As Myonei has quite a lot of goods to transport offworld at any given time, there is never a lull in the bustle of the spaceport bar. Freighter captains make up most of the clientele, as the workers tend to work continuous shifts and head straight to Culex when they get off.</bar>

   <description>The Dvaered war machine relies a lot on flinging chunks of matter at enemy ships, and those chunks of matter have to come from somewhere. Myuirr Station is one of the most productive ammunition production facilities in Dvaered space. It produces ordinance for a variety of ballistic and missile weaponry. The portion of its produce that isn't claimed by Dvaered High Command in tax is sold to Warlords, retailers and civilians for profit.</description>

   <description>Nappi is one of those names that gets chuckled over in distant spaceport bars. The world is home to a small population that moves across the face of the planet as the seasons progress, living a semi-nomadic life. The capital city is always populated though, because it is the only link to the rest of the galaxy.</description>
   <bar>Few offworlders venture beyond the spaceport bar. There is little to do in the capital city other than to conduct trade, and the outside air becomes unpleasant after only minutes of exposure. Besides, there's very little to see, unless you enjoy looking at endless stretches of rock and sand.</bar>

   <description>Though life on Neurri is tough, the planet has nevertheless evolved to one of the most prominent pieces of real estate in Soromid space. Kataka's presence implies that Feye gets a lot of traffic, so economically Neurri is in a good position. The world mostly subsists on rendering services to Kataka, though a modest private ship building company has settled here as well.</description>
   <bar>For many non-Soromid, Neurri's bar is a home away from home. Quite a lot of traders come to this planet, so the spaceport bar always has a high number of "regulars" in it. Not that they really mind being around the Soromid, of course. Fine people, the Soromid. They just start giving you the creeps after a while, know what I mean?</bar>

   <description>New Dortmund was founded by the very first colony ship to leave Earth, Genesis. The planet itself was known only by its systematic designation for a long time, New Dortmund being the name of the settlement. However, since the settlement was the only thing the colonists knew for many years, its name became synonymous with the world. The moon Folevo was named after the leader of the Genesis expedition, who sadly perished only a few years after the initial touchdown.
New Dortmund was never very successful in any sense of the term, but it is still pulling its weight in the overall Frontier economy.</description>
   <bar>New Dortmund's spaceport bar is mostly deserted, the locals frequenting their own establishments and offworlders preferring to stay with their ships. The only reason the place is still running is because the Frontier Council subsidizes it, on the basis that a spaceport bar will help attract people to New Dortmund. So far, it hasn't.</bar>

   <description>New Haven is a planet located beyond the boundaries of law and justice. Founded by Bartax the Great, one of the most successful pirates to ever live, after Haven was annihilated. The planet's atmosphere is highly toxic and has high levels of radiation outside of the stronghold. These very features are what made the Empire classify it as uninhabitable, as it lacks strategic resources necessary to justify the cost of terraforming. Its distance from other civilized worlds affords it protection from prying eyes.</description>
   <bar>The Slop and Grill is one of the nastiest taverns in the universe. The food and drink don't help matters. Most of it is brewed on New Haven and wouldn't pass any of the minimal health insurance tests. Some of the booze even doubles as ship fuel if needed. The clients are also deep space thugs, pirates, black marketers, mercenaries and other shady folk that insist on keeping the ground coated with blood and broken teeth. Not a great place to bring the family.</bar>

   <description>The Emperor's Fist project needs a lot of raw materials. A portion of those materials are mined right here on New Mars, which has the advantage that no trip through hyperspace is needed to get them to location. New Mars is being systematically strip-mined, and as such the planet has nothing to offer in the way of leisure or tourism.</description>
   <bar>Clean and functional, this bar has been built according to recent Imperial standards. It's more a utility service than a place to unwind.</bar>

   <description>Although not a large installation by any measure, Niflheim is the main commercial station in the southwestern quadrant of Empire space. Though it doesn't see as much traffic as the more centrally located trade hubs, it provides a good opportunity for traders between the Empire, the Za'lek and the Consortium to meet and greet. Of course, the Imperial Navy also uses this station as a base of operations.</description>
   <bar>On Niflheim, space is at a premium. As such there is not much room to spare for leisure, which shows in the spaceport bar. All tables are stand-up arrangements, and there is not much room to maneuver. Any visitor will have to be prepared for some necessary intimacies if he wants to frequent this establishment.</bar>

   <description>Nixa is a young colony. It was first settled mere years before the Incident occurred. With the galaxy-wide economic collapse that followed in its wake, Nixa's budding growth came close to a halt. The population struggles to make the colonization project a success even so, but now that Dune has become a fringe system, chances of that seem remote.</description>
   <bar>Nixa's bar is still the makeshift affair it was when the planet was first colonized. There haven't been the resources nor the time to replace it with something more solid.</bar>

   <description>Nonuri is a world with an under-developed economy, even by Frontier standards. It barely manages to keep itself from going bankrupt. The people who live here stay mainly out of a sense of belonging, a feeling that Nonuri is their birthright. In fact, Nonuri was colonized by the colony ship Petrovosk, which makes Nonuri one of the oldest extrasolar human settlements. Unfortunately for the locals, most of the galaxy doesn't care quite as much as they do.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is humble, yet tidy and functional. The Nonurians may not enjoy a rich life, but they make the most of what they've got. Though the equipment is outdated, in some cases by several generations, this bar has most of the things an intergalactic traveler needs to keep abreast of events.</bar>

The Dvaered are loathed here, and it's rumored that the local shipyard is a major source of FLF vessels.</description>
   <bar>The Norpin II bar isn't the safest place around. With a deep-seated loathing of the Dvaered, the local citizens have brawled with Dvaered soldiers on numerous occasions.</bar>

Increasingly, Empire officials are settling here, given its close proximity to Gamma Polaris. In the time since then, it's become a supplier of many materials for the project, gaining importance within the Empire.</description>
   <bar>While not a grandiose affair, the spaceport bar is reasonably sized and immaculately clean. Due to the increasing number of Empire officials making their home here, it remains busy throughout the day.</bar>

   <bar>Every visitor to Onar is required to check in at the spaceport bar immediately after landing. Nobody is allowed off the premises of the spaceport without a good reason, and even then they will be accompanied by an official Dvaered chaperone.

   <description>The Onyx Shipyard is a modern, high-tech shipyard. At least by Dvaered standards. The place builds both combat and trade vessels, and commissions a portion of the Dvaered fleet. Several Warlords also have personal contracts at Onyx, drawing ships for their private fleets from here.</description>
   <bar>Each table in the spaceport bar is themed around a ship design that is manufactured here. Some are even built out of old or faulty components of the ships in question. Of course it's not very artistic, considering that a Dvaered came up with it, but there's still a certain class to it that gets potential buyers in the mood.</bar>

   <description>Since Varaati is located in a rather isolated corner of the galaxy, the local government decided to invest in a trade station within the system, to attract more traffic. Though the station is a far cry from commercial powerhouses like Darkshed, Opal Station must be considered a good effort by Frontier standards.</description>
   <bar>The spacedock bar is geared towards trading. There are private booths, tables with integrated data uplinks, a ship outfitting service and charts on the walls showing nearby trade opportunities. The place is never quite packed with people, but there is enough activity in the bar to indicate that Opal Station is slowly returning on its investment.</bar>

   <description>The Soromid have only started challenging Oring as recently as 30 SCU ago. Though the planet has no soil suitable for cultivation and is constantly plagued by rust winds, the Soromid intend to one day house a large population on this world. Right now, there is a modest number of colonists living in underground habitats while the terraforming complexes on the surface labor to alter the atmospheric makeup. It's quite fascinating, to someone who's into this sort of thing.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is not too remarkable, as you might expect from a colonist world. The place is functional and simple. There is, however, a public display that shows the current state of the terraforming operation. It never visibly changes, but the graphs show that over the cycles, progress is being made.</bar>

   <description>Orville Shipyard is a relatively modest ship building facility, though it is invaluable to Inios Station and Brandt Station, as most of their reinforcements come from here. The station relies on Mastodon Station for the ships' energy cores and weaponry, as Rhu is too far removed from Aesir to send the ships to be outfitted at Sirius Ordnance.</description>
   <bar>Over the bar in this facility, there is a counter display that keeps track of the amount of ships that have been produced at Orville Shipyard since it was commissioned. Clearly, the people here at Rhu take pride in being able to contribute to the Sirian military effort.</bar>

   <description>Paul 2 is a planet of merchants and entrepreneurs. Though the planet doesn't have a global government as such, the population has agreed on a number of general rules that count as law of some sort. It works surprisingly well.</description>
   <bar>Like many planets in the galaxy nowadays, Paul 2's economy relies heavily on interplanetary trade. The spaceport bar doubles as a trade center, allowing traders to buy and sell wares without ever leaving the spaceport.</bar>

   <description>Percola is a small world, but it is a rather major producer of food within Soromid space. The planet is rich in carbon and gets a lot of sun, so plant life thrives here. The planet sometimes manages as many as four harvests a cycle. About seventy per cent of the land surface is used for agriculture, ten per cent is used for livestock and the remaining twenty per cent is for the residents and supporting infrastructure.</description>
   <bar>This spaceport bar has a view on one of the nearby mega-meadows that sprawl across Percola. The endless sea of uniform vegetation is impressive to behold, but it's only really a small part of what's out there.</bar>

But that's about as far as it goes. Petaat is a very unpleasant world, its surface constantly plagued by dust storms and its soil unfit for crop growing. The people living here only do so because they don't have the means to leave.</description>
   <bar>Amazingly, Petaat does have a spaceport bar, despite the fact that this is, well, Petaat. It's rather a dump, though. If you didn't know better you'd think yourself in a decaying slum. Most people here look like they belong in one, too.</bar>

But rather than feel dissatisfied about this, the population takes pride in its history of military service. These people are true Dvaered.</description>
   <bar>The owner of the bar has served in several Dvaered campaigns in his day, and it shows. The bar is decorated with trophies and other memorabilia from those days, and the man will tell anyone who will listen about what he calls his glory days.</bar>

   <description>Acting as the primary gateway for goods traveling to and from Father's Pride, Point Zero Station is a busy commercial port. Many traders are willing to trade here rather than take the trouble of visiting the systems beyond Point Zero themselves, though there's always the entrepreneur who believes the extra jumps will be worth the payout.</description>
   <bar>Reminiscent of the stock markets on pre-Federation Earth, the spacedock bar of Point Zero Station is one of the biggest and most important facilities aboard. People come here on business just as much as to socialize. Commodity exchange rates are displayed on big screens along the walls, and for a small fee a pilot can make use of a private trade booth.</bar>

   <description>Polaris Prime has recently become home to the Emperor himself as he plans and constructs his new stronghold on Emperor's Fist. It is an immense station with booming commerce, with a large loading area and frequent freight transfers between the station and Emperor's Fist below.</description>
   <bar>Since you aren't allowed in the fancier bars you wander into the spaceport bar. A simple, utilitarian bar patronized largely by off-duty dock workers and terraformers, it is nonetheless kept immaculately clean. You can only imagine how luxurious the Emperor's personal bar must be.</bar>

   <description>Praxis is an anomaly in Dvaered culture, known for its commerce rather than production of materials. Beginning as a small colony, it has become increasingly important since the Incident. Praxis is now considered one of the core Dvaered worlds, the gateway through which Dvaered ore and materials flow into Empire space.</description>
   <bar>While not nearly as pristine as many Empire bars, the Praxis bar is remarkably well-kept for a Dvaered bar.</bar>

   <description>Protera Sigma is the only Proteron colony known to have survived the Incident. One of the earlier Proteron settlements, it has an established shipyard and access to the original blueprints, so Proteron shipbuilding traditions live on.</description>
   <bar>Rather distinct from traditional Empire bars, the Protera Sigma bar is entirely open and without seats, as the Proteron believe one should stand while eating and drinking. Despite this curiosity, their brews don't stray far from typical Empire faire.</bar>

   <description>Qoral is primarily a resource-producing world. The terrain is mostly barren and unfit for human habitation, so most of the population is concentrated on a few stretches of suitable land, scattered around the globe, while the rest of the land mass is littlered with strip mines.</description>
   <bar>This is a fairly typical spaceport bar. The clientele consists mostly of merchants, though some locals come here also, if not for the drinks then for the chance to talk to people who come from more interesting places than Qoral.</bar>

   <description>Racheka is a relatively young Sirius colony. Where most Sirius planets are converted planets that once belonged to another faction, Racheka was actually established by Sirius colonists a considerable time after Sirichana settled on Mutris. Perhaps for this reason the Sirian religion can be felt very strongly here, as there are no remnants of other cultures mingling in the lives of the population.</description>
   <bar>The first thing anyone notices when they step into the bar is the ceiling, which is a holographic display of the galaxy, centered around Anarbalis. Though an impressive display as well as a marvel of technology, the bar's proprietor apparently doesn't realize that many of his customers spend all day looking at the stars, and therefore have little desire to look at them when onworld.</bar>

   <description>Constructed by many captured and then enslaved FLF armsmen. The station seems sturdy, but you can't help wondering whether there's a bomb hidden somewhere, waiting to kill the Dvaered oppressors.</description>
   <bar>The Raelid bar fits the Dvaered stereotype well. It's one of the more prominent areas as soon as you exit the docking area, and, as many Dvaered bars seem to be, it's much larger than it functionally needs to be. Far from the spotless bars of Polaris Prime, it's encrusted with dirt and you can sense the presence of other patrons by their smell alone. Truly, a Dvaered bar.</bar>

   <description>Raglan Outpost is the Dvaereds' single most visible presence in Frontier space. Officially, the station is a mixture of a trade station and an embassy for Dvaered citizens, but it is public knowledge that the Dvaered use the base as a stronghold in their fight against the FLF, and many Frontier inhabitants fear that in time it will also be the staging point for the Dvaered invasion of the Frontier.</description>
   <bar>The Raglan bar is a utilitarian affair, quite small and nearly empty. Though Dvaereds do like to drink, all outpost personnel are under standing orders to remain on alert, given the threat of FLF attack.</bar>

   <description>Some planets just don't have the capacity to feed their own populations, despite advanced crop-growing techniques. Reidd is not one of those planets. In fact, Reidd's orbit and axial inclination make it such a good farming world that it can supply many worlds in nearby systems. The local government acknowledges this, and has dedicated 97% of Reidd's land surface to agricultural operations.</description>
   <bar>In what might be a slight case of overreaction, Reidd's bar is underground, so as not to have to sacrifice any land surface. Still, the primary difference between this bar and most others in the galaxy is that pilots have to take an elevator to reach this one.</bar>

   <description>Rionna is a cold world, but it was not always so. Only a hundred years ago, it was classified as a class M planet, though even then it was on the chilly side. The reason why the face of the planet is covered in ice now is that the local star is going through a dim phase. Astronomers have predicted that in another century and a half, the star will brighten up again, and Rionna will once again be green. The population has dug in, preferring to wait for better years than to move offworld and leave their homes behind.</description>
   <bar>This spaceport bar is wholly unremarkable. It could be any other bar on any other planet. The only thing that reminds you that you're still on Rionna is that the patrons are all wearing warm clothes.</bar>

   <description>Rudderfern is a small but wealthy Soromid colony. Its primary, Father's Pride III, is far too hostile for even the Soromid to utilize, but its moon has very Earth-like properties, apart from its low gravity. Many well-to-do Soromid have settled here, enjoying the pleasant environment and the high level of security offered in Father's Pride.</description>
   <bar>Most planets have spaceport bars. Not Rudderfern. It has a spaceport lounge. It has classy furniture, richly decorated walls and ceilings, and even actual Soromid serving personnel. Rudderfern rather takes pride in officially having the highest class spaceport bar in the known galaxy.</bar>

   <description>Sabe and Anya are a pair of planets tidally locked to eachother, rotating around their shared center of gravity. Sabe is the center of the Thurian goverment, housing the largest population of both uploaded and biological Thurions, acting as the de-facto capital. The majority of the planet's surface is untouched, as virtually all its inhabitants reside in the multitude of arcologies spread across its surface.</description>

   <description>On the edge of the Delta Pavonis system, unnoticed by all but a few, orbits the tiny world of Seanich. Though technically a registered Imperial colony, this backwater planet does not receive the attention that should come with its status. The population is decidedly upset about this, to the point that the local administration has stopped paying taxes to the central Imperial government in protest. The Imperial government hasn't noticed.</description>
   <bar>Seanich has a pretty well-appointed spaceport bar. It has all the facilities a spacer could need, and many are quite up to date. Sadly, this hasn't helped to make the unfortunate colony more conspicuous in the galaxy. Most of the tables are empty.</bar>

   <description>Selphod is a harsh and barren ice planet. Most of the locals have never ventured outside the established bases. Outdoor travels require heavy thermal protection with a personal generator to keep the wearer from succumbing to hypothermia. Many have met a swift, excruciatingly painful end by venturing out in ill-sealed thermal suits.</description>

   <description>Though Semper is slightly on the poor side by Imperial standards, the people who live here at least have the comfort of tight Imperial security. For that reason, it is quite popular among immigrants into the Empire, who usually don't have the means to settle on the richer civilian worlds.</description>
   <bar>Semper is an immigrant world, which is reflected in its spaceport bar. The design betrays influences from all over the galaxy, such as a holograph of a Dvaered cruiser, a Sirius crest on some of the furniture and even some Soromid-oriented drinks.</bar>

   <description>Since well before the rise of House Dvaered, Sheik Hall has been an important exporter of precious metals and valuable minerals. The people on this planet make their living by mining those resources, and crafting jewellery out of them. Though the planet's raw output isn't very high by any standard, the amount of money involved is on par with a medium-sized mining colony.</description>
   <bar>The bar is ornately decorated with all that glitters and gleams. Of course, everything you can see here is a replica, as the real valuables are all shipped offworld. Nevertheless, it's attractive to pretend that you're surrounded by riches for a moment.</bar>

Like all Dvaered nobles he was a Warlord, and his victories in battle as well as the manner in which he won them earned him the respect in his House as well as the rest of the Empire. The planet that came to bear his name was the last of his conquests, and ultimately became his final resting place. The tomb is a popular destination for Dvaered pilgrims.</description>
   <bar>Sinclair's spaceport bar is run by entrepreneurs, not warriors. But being entrepreneurs, they recognize the value of catering to the locals and to those that pass through, and so it is that this bar has a large holoportrait of Godfried Sinclair hanging over the bar, and his family's weapon can be seen on various decorative fixtures.</bar>

   <description>From the outside, FLF station Sindbad looks like a piece of junk. This suits the FLF, as their base isn't meant to stand out. The more travelers believe that the station is just another carcass floating in space, the better. On the inside however, Sindbad looks, well, it still looks like a piece of junk. The FLF have limited resources, and the fact that they have a secret, autonomous outpost at all must be considered an achievement. Still, Sindbad is more than a token resistance. The base has all the facilities and defensive capabilities that befit a structure its size, and while stealth remains the FLF's best protection from their Dvaered oppressors, Sindbad can defend itself if need be.</description>
   <bar>The FLF don't have much use for leisures, so it's debatable whether this place can be called a bar. Still, it provides space to sit and talk, and it serves a liquid that seems different from industrial acid, in that it doesn't burn a hole through your stomach. The people here are mostly hard-faced men, and the topics of conversation are limited to the Dvaered and the FLF's cause.</bar>

It's not so much a station as it is a gigantic mass replicator, capable of replicating entire spaceships given design blueprints and enough raw materials. The facility is of unknown origin. Some believe it to be alien, but there is no proof of this. So far, mankind has yet to design a ship too big for Sixbat to handle.</description>

   <description>The Soromid and the rest of the galaxy have enjoyed a tense kind of friendship ever since the first bioships launched from Sorom. The rest of humanity is keenly interested in the Soromid genetic treatments, and the Soromid in turn are happy to turn a profit on their expertise, but there's still some degree of caution on both sides. Soromid Customs Central is a visible sign of that caution. It houses a full division of Soromid ships, and is responsible for maintaining order as well as inspecting the traffic that passes through Oberon.</description>

   <description>The Soromid Databank is the primary Soromid data center. All administration about interplanetary policy as well as the records of the gene treatment industry are managed here. This is why, although the Soromid Databank is not a military base, it has been classified a restricted facility.</description>
   <bar>Most visitors don't make it past the spacedock bar, not even ranking Soromid personnel. The data center is managed mostly by internal automated drones, requiring manual maintenance only occasionally. Information requests are taken at booths adjoining the spacedock bar, which are manned by secretive-looking Soromid who never leave the station.</bar>

   <description>As everyone knows, the Soromid are exporters of genetic treatment services. People from all over the galaxy travel to Soromid space to have their natural abilities enhanced, diseases cured or appearances improved. All of these people need to be treated somewhere, and this is one such place. Soromid Wards Alpha is a massive medical facility, the largest of all the Soromid Wards. Thousands of clients can be treated here at any one time. Most of the station's volume is taken up by personal treatment tanks, where clients spend anything from a week to months in an artificial coma while their genetic code is rewritten.</description>

Of course these advanced procedrues come at a higher cost, so the clients visiting Beta tend to be from the upper classes of galactic society.</description>

The operations here are geared toward a higher tolerance for modification that normal humans would likely not survive. The patients here are usually colonists or working personnel who need to adapt themselves to a particular climate.</description>

   <description>Sroolu is the lone moon oribiting An'ku II. The colony here mostly concerns itself with harvesting the resources that can be found in An'ku, refining them for processing and even producing some low-level end products out of them. The operation seems to be making profit, though it seems it is fated to remain a minor player in the Sirian economy.</description>
   <bar>Sroolu is only a small colony, but its bar is huge, even by intergalactic standards. It seems whoever built it intended for the entire workforce to fit inside at once. Suffice to say only part of the bar's floor surface is actually in use, the remaining space being screened off by mobile panels.</bar>

   <description>Stutee is a former prison world of the Old Empire. Since it had a breathable atmosphere and little else, it was deemed perfect for dropping off criminals and then forgetting about them. However, as the lower class workers rebelled against the Empire, resulting in the inception of House Dvaered, Stutee came to fall under the jurisdiction of the new Great House. House Dvaered decided to settle Stutee more permanently, bringing the former convicts under their rule and setting them to work. Though Stutee is still of little material value, its location one jump off Dvaer makes up for that.</description>
   <bar>Stutee's bar is located right off the spaceport. Though the planet has been settled and proper infrastructure is now present, the world is not very appealing to any who visit. As such, the spaceport bar is arguably the most important meeting place on the face of the moon.</bar>

   <bar>This spaceport bar is unsavory. No other word will describe the place with the same accuracy. A good portion of the bar's clientele are wearing hoods, masks, or other garments to hide their personal features. The lighting is set to quite a dim level, allowing customers to find corners as dark as they please. Despite these obvious signs, the Dvaered officials that sometimes frequent the bar don't seem very keen to investigate.</bar>

   <description>Though Suoer classifies as a moon, it is technically a sister planet to Esker IV. Its superdense core gives it so much gravity that it significantly affects its primary, so both planets orbit each other.

   <bar>What is a spaceport bar? A miserable pile of drink, noise, data terminals, and of course the occasional fight. Takeru's bar has all of these components, which makes it a comfortable place to be for anyone with more than a few light years under his belt.</bar>

   <description>Tankard Station is a Sirius economical space facility. It processes a large portion of all trade transactions made within An'ku, and also serves as a terminal for the materials produced by Sroolu. There is also a small security detail stationed here, but this is merely for the purpose of customs, not so much the repulsion of hostile elements.</description>
   <bar>Serving both as a trading hub and an outlet of consumer end products, the spacedock bar on Tankard Station is always a bustle of activity. In fact, the actual bar seems more like a section of a larger commerce center than the other way around.</bar>

   <description>Tau Station was constructed with the sole purpose of exploiting the algae produced on Tau Prime. Being a completely oceanic world with a highly corrosive atmosphere, it was deemed more profitable to build an orbiting station, rather than a platform city on the surface. From the station windows you can see heavy algae collectors flying to and from the surface on their endless algae runs.</description>
   <bar>The Tau Prime algae has a powerful odour which pervades the bar. The air is wreathed in the smell, such that you can taste it. It doesn't taste nearly as good unprocessed. Most algae runners stop to grab drinks between runs to try to get the taste of the algae out of their mouth, though the liquors the bar serves happen to be made with processed algae.</bar>

   <description>Thar is a simple mining world owned by the Dvaered. It has a very variable atmosphere that can rapidly alternate from several kilometres wide to barely existent. The pressure changes are harmful to most lifeforms, making it an almost completely sterile planet. With the advent of terraforming techniques it was finally made habitable for humans so they could exploit some of its many resources.</description>

   <description>The Wringer is actually called Ulysses Outpost, but apart from a few worn, rusted name plates there is nothing that reminds the people onboard of that name. Once an outlying scientific installation of the Old Empire, the facility was abandoned as the funds needed to keep it running dried up under ever increasing budget cuts following the end of the Empire's golden age. Since then, the station has been claimed by petty criminals and loners, people who are persona non grata in whatever region they come from, but are unwilling or unable to turn pirate. Needless to say, the Wringer is not the most pleasant of places, and few come here by choice. Even the Touched avoid the Wringer, despite the fact that Suna is within Sirius borders.</description>
   <bar>The Wringer doesn't have a clear infrastructure, but most people agree that this compartment counts as the spaceport bar. It distinguishes itself by having slightly more drunks lying in the corners than the rest of the station, thanks to the availability of booze at the fenced-off bar on one side.</bar>

   <description>It's a nickname, of course. How could it not be? Trouble is, nobody remembers where the name came from, and, bizarrely, there are no records of the station's original name. It's quite a famous story, both within Hekaras and elsewhere. Meanwhile, all involved simply call it Three and a half Kings. It seems to work for them.</description>
   <bar>This is a typical stationside bar. It has viewports looking into space, which are of course ignored by everyone, since anyone who comes to a station like this has seen all the space they could possibly want to.</bar>

   <description>People sometimes joke that Soromid will live anywhere, like vermin. This is not true. But a pilot looking at the colony on Thymo might well understand why people say such things. The planet is uninteresting by all means, having little in the way of natural resources and lacking an atmosphere entirely. But the Soromid still live here, mainly because they can. Thymo counts as a civilian world, albeit not a very rich one.</description>

   <description>When the thirteenth colony ship, Yamato Nadeshiko, arrived at Tori, it was sterile. though it had both water and carbon in abundant supply, there was no life to be found. With the arrival of the mostly Asian human colonists, this changed. Human flora thrived on the planet, and within a century the planet had acquired a fully functional ecosystem. This marvel has inspired the inhabitants of Tori to leave much of the world's surface to nature. Though this means Tori's economoc potential remains largely untapped, the thriving tourist industry largely compensates.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is more than just functional. Since most new arrivals on the planet come here first, the authorities have taken pains to make the bar appealing and comfortable. Of course, the fact that Tori is a tourist attraction also means drinks are quite expensive in this bar...</bar>

   <description>Torloth is a heavy mining planet. It has rich ores and minerals in abundance with no local fauna to speak of. It's one of the strongholds of the Nexus corporation, housing some of their important ship factories, though the heavy gravity of the planet necessitates constructing larger ships off-world. Torloth produces ships exclusively for delivery to Nexus depots and endorsed shipyards.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is carved from a rich mineral deposit lending the walls a glimmering, reflective quality. The local brews often include minerals in their production process, giving them a rich, somewhat saline taste.</bar>

The air is buzzing with excitement, and it's hard to make oneself heard over the din. For this reason, orders are placed through terminals projected onto the table surface, and drinks are served from a small dispenser in the middle of the table.

   <description>Traal is a pleasant civilian world. With stable tectonics and a favorable climate on most of its land masses, the world makes for good living. It comes as no surprise that the Dvaered eye it greedily, so close to their borders, but so long as Inios Station guards Eye of Night, Dvaered High Command can't claim Traal.</description>
   <bar>Traal's spaceport bar is heavy on Sirian propaganda. With foreign territories just a jump away, the Sirii feel the need to spread their beliefs, even if only passively. Though House Sirius has stopped expanding in recent years, the Traalians believe that Sirichana is merely taking a pause to stabilize the existing Sirian worlds. Soon, they say, Fidelis will be Sirius space.</bar>

   <description>Trincea is one of the most heavily populated worlds in Dvaered space. As such it is a rather attractive planet for Warlords to fight over, so the laws of the planet are prone to frequent change. The citizens have grown used to it, though, adapting to new legislation as a matter of course. By Dvaered standards, they're exceptionally flexible in their thinking.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is subject to the whims of the Warlords just like anything else on the face of the planet, so it is best to check the local rules every time you set your ship down on Trincea. Fortunately, having drinks and checking the news have never been outlawed so far.</bar>

   <description>Triton Station is a shipyard station that's owned by the Empire, but most of its compartments have been leased by the Nexus corporation. The company produces combat-capable ships here, and given the stability of the neighboring systems, there certainly is a market for them.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is a public facility onboard the station, and so the Empire runs it. As such, the bar complies with galactic standards, something that might not have been the case if Nexus had been in charge.</bar>

   <description>There is literally a world of difference between Thymo and Turawee. Unlike its barren cousin, Turawee is a lush, comfortable world that was never charted even during the Third Growth. The Soromid, having few natural M-class planets at their disposal, take good care of this world. While most other factions would struggle with the trade-off between prosperity and ecology, the Soromid have managed to strike a perfect balance. Turawee may be the only inhabited planet in the galaxy whose environment has not been significantly altered in any way by its occupants.</description>
   <bar>The Soromid are very protective of Turawee. Offworlders are allowed to land, but they have to abide by strict local rules. No smoking is allowed in this bar, nor can any unauthorized goods or substances be brought inside.</bar>

   <description>Ulios is a backwater independent world. Though a province of the Old Empire before the Incident, the planet has recently declared its independence and is now governed by a small political elite headed by Baron Dovai Sauterfeldt. As the Empire is all but impotent in this region of space and the world is too remote and isolated to be of much interest to the Dvaered, Ulios' independence stands.</description>
   <bar>Despite the relatively accommodating interior, Ulios' spaceport bar doesn't get too many customers. Traders do visit the world, but as there is little profit to be made the ships are few and far between. The captains often choose to conduct their business and move on rather than stay and kick back for a few STP.</bar>

   <description>Ullnorn isn't actually a habitable planet, and there is no good reason why humans should make their home here. The fact that they do can be traced back to a Dvaered in-house conflict between two minor Warlords, who each claimed dominion over Ginger and everything in it. With both sides unwilling to back down, it came down to whoever held a permanent presence in the system. Thus, the colony on Ullnorn was established. Today, it is populated by Dvaered citizens unwilling to live there, but too stubborn to leave, lest their rivals claim victory in the age-old dispute.</description>
   <bar>This is a bar. It has to be, because you usually don't have to pay for muddy rainwater. It doesn't seem this place is frequented by its patrons for the purpose of entertainment, because there are no recreational facilities, not even a jukebox. The few appointments are welded to the floor, and everything else is either made out of steel or has steel bars covering it. Clearly, this is a place where fists meet faces. Maybe you shouldn't stay here too long...</bar>

   <description>Urail is a halfway decently habitable planet. Its proximity to Mutris makes it a very popular place to live for Sirii, which has driven the price of real estate to almost ridiculous heights. Many Sirii believe that living on Urail gives them a better chance of meeting a Touched, or even being called to Crater City themselves. There is no indication that this is indeed the case, however.</description>
   <bar>Every spaceport needs a spaceport bar. That is probably the only reason why Urail has one, since the population would much prefer to use the space so build housing for upper echelon Sirii. Nevertheless, the bar is comfortable enough, despite the pricey drinks.</bar>

   <description>Urbanus Crops is one of House Dvaered's crop growing complexes. Though the idea was largely 'borrowed' from the Empire's INSS series, the efficiency of the actual installation is somewhat lower, because of the Dvaered's inferior technological background. Urbanus Crops gets the job done, though, and in fact most of Trincea's food is grown here.</description>
   <bar>If you didn't know better, you'd think you were on a Dvaered military base, from the look of the bar. It's utterly utilitarian, though in the owner's defense an attempt has been made at fitting in with the station's purpose, testament the withered plant on the corner of the bar.</bar>

   <description>Many people who live in the Empire think of the Dvaered as unsophisticated, brawny louts who spend all day down in the mines and all night picking fights with each other. This is a stereotype, and it's hardly a fair description of Dvaered society as a whole, but it happens to be absolutely accurate when it comes to the Dvaereds on Utsuwa. The colony on this planet is a full-time mining operation, and all who live on Utsuwa work in the mining industry or its peripherals. Needless to say, House Dvaered gets a significant amount of its raw resources from here.</description>
   <bar>This bar is a miner's bar, alpha and omega. Virtually all its patrons are miners, and they do what miners do, which is drink, fight, and talk about miner things. Fortunately, the owner of the bar is considerate of outside visitors, so in addition to Miner's Ale, Miner's Vodka, Miner's Whiskey and Bloody Miners you can also order a light beer, which has a little wooden miner's pickaxe in it.</bar>

   <description>Valt is recent home to a Dvaered mining colony. An utterly inhospitable world, the extremely thin atmosphere makes the surface highly dangerous due to its perpetual bombardment by asteroids and solar radiation. The colony is situated nearly a kilometre below the planet's surface, in an immense, resource-rich cavern.</description>
   <bar>The Valt spaceport bar is nothing special. It's rather clean for a Dvaered bar, though that may speak more about the small size of the settlement than the pride the proprietor takes in keeping his establishment clean.</bar>

Though high-yield terraformind was still unknown in those days, the ship did have rather effective atmospheric equalizers and soil enhancers, which allowed it to transform Varaati from a primordeal world into a stable class M. Despite this success, Varaati's economic development started relatively late in the game, placing it a good distance behind Hope and Tori.</description>
   <bar>Varaati's spaceport bar is one of those places where everything is in a state of disrepair, where none of the safety regulations are met and where the air is thick with odors you don't want to guess the origin of. In short, it's a great place to hang out.</bar>

   <description>Varia is a Dvaered world, so it can't be called lush or relaxing. But it's the next best thing. The climate on Varia is as close to old Earth's as makes no difference, and the inhabitants of this world typically lead healthy, long lives. In fact, the planet is so nice that some feel it is wasted on the Dvaered, who misuse the bounty the planet offers for their crude, destructive forms of entertainment.</description>
   <bar>Varia's bar is more like a bar complex than a bar. With multiple rooms, each decorated in different styles and each serving different beverages, the discerning alcoholic with money to spare could spend all week here without ever getting bored. Most of the merchants and businesspeople prefer to stick to the main room, however.</bar>

   <description>Vertigo is the second moon orbiting Nartur IV. While the rock itself is utterly uninteresting, it's Nartur's first moon that is. It is a semi-fluid sphere of valuable mineral that often gets used in hyperdrives. Vertigo is the closest place where a harvesting base can be set up, short of building a whole new starbase.</description>
   <bar>Vertigo's spaceport bar has an excellent view of Nartur IV and IVa. Depending on the phase of the various orbital cycles, it can be quite a fetching sight. Of course, some of the time there's very little to see at all.</bar>

   <description>Frozen worlds are usually not colonized unless there is very good reason. Vilati Vilata is no exception. The world offers a wealth of valuable natural resources, as well as expansive subglacial cavern systems that lend themselves quite well to human habitation. The Dvaered have based what would become one of their most successful industrial franchises on this planet, so although nobody likes living here, the place is home to a sizeable amount of workers.</description>
   <bar>The bar is cold. It must be mentioned. Every effort has been made to minimize loss of heat from the building, but given the bar's close proximity to the spaceport, which is exposed to the elements, and the constant flow of customers, it has proven impossible to keep out the cold. This situation has given rise to a number of unkind jokes about the Vilati bar, which are told throughout the galaxy.</bar>

   <description>Though Vino is a good world for civilian habitation by most standards, the local government is rather distrustful of offworlders. It has made immigration procedures so arduous that the vast majority of potential newcomers gives up when they see the requirements. On the flipside, Vinoan citizens are loath to leave their world, be it temporarily or permanently. This makes Vino an isolated enclave, although trade is still at a decent level despite everything.</description>
   <bar>Vino has a spaceport bar, but only because the government couldn't close it down without running into Empire-wide spaceport regulations. So although the place is open and functional, no effort has been spared to make the place as inhospitable and unpleasant as possible. Real seasoned traders have learned to ignore it, though.</bar>

   <description>Vlexair is a harsh, frozen world. Formerly a lush paradise, an internal cataclysm caused its molten core to solidify, resulting in an ice age. Virtually no flora or fauna exist outside of the station. Due to its an extremely dangerous environment, it's proven suitable only to the Dvaered workers.</description>
   <bar>The Vlexair bar is small, as far as Dvaered bars go. There's not much variety of drink other than the standard Dvaered grogs.</bar>

   <description>Vorca has long been the main base of operations of small time gangsters and crooks, but it didn't grow into a serious Pirate clan until the Dvaered Revolts. In that time of tension and discord, many decided to turn their backs on the Empire entirely and eke out a new life and accrue wealth by taking it from others. Those who survived in that line of work flocked to Vorca, and now the planet is host to an impressive fleet of private, more-or-less similarly aligned ships.</description>
   <bar>The average space pilot would, when walking into a Pirate bar, expect utter chaos, frought with boozing, gambling, violence and narcotic substances. This is an expectation the bar on Vorca does not live up to. As a matter of fact, the establisment is quite tightly policed by henchmen of the clan leaders, and as such is one of the most orderly places within several jumps. The bar serves as a neutral ground among the Pirates themselves, and a meeting place for those who, for whatever reason, want to solicit their aid.</bar>

   <description>The Emperor's Fist project needs labor. A lot of labor. And while the world itself remains unfit for habitation, the workforce needs someplace else to live. The inhabitants of Halir refused to provide them shelter, invoking various complicated rights and regulations, so rather than persuade the local government, the Imperial Council decided to deploy prefab survival units on Vuere. As such, Vuere should be considered a temporary camp rather than a colony. However, with a population this size and a projected duration of stay this long, it is doubtful if Vuere will ever truly be abandoned.</description>
   <bar>The bar is surprisingly hospitable for such a makeshift settlement. The inhabitants apparently feel the need to make up for the harsh environment of their C-class planet by making their indoor areas as comfortable and appeasing as they can. The bar is a prime example of this.</bar>

   <description>Part of the reason why Warei's surface is permanently frozen is because the planet's core is cold. This is a fascinating abberation from the standard planetary model, but more than that it offers great economical possibilities as there are vast amounts of raw minerals to be had under the crust. The Soromid have taken to set up a parts and ship manufacutring complex here.</description>
   <bar>Even the Soromid need protection from the cold climate, but they're certainly more resistant to it than normal humans. Most non-Soromid traders visiting Warei complain about the cold - the ambient temperature in the bar is far from comfortable.</bar>

   <description>In the days of the Old Empire, Waterhole was the farthest outpost of the Empire. To the Imperials, it was the last outpost of civilization, the last bastion of safety before venturing out into the systems beyond. It is because of this that Waterhole, the system and the planet, derive their names. Now, centuries later, Waterhole remains at the border of Empire space. It is still the last stop for traders venturing out, and the first of those coming in.</description>
   <bar>Waterhole's moon wouldn't be Waterhole's moon if its bar wasn't called The Waterhole. Though the place is open to visitors from all origins and walks of life, the majority of the clientele is Imperial in nature. It seems that nothing creates a longing for home like being away from it for prolonged periods of time.</bar>

   <description>While the main line of Soromid military ship production is located on Heronus in Uridhrion, there is a secondary ship plant here on Wigheta. Wigheta does not grow the regular models, however. Instead, the world is acts as a research facility for bioships, where new designs and growth methods are invented and tested. It's a slow and expensive process, and Wigheta only produces a useful result once every few cycles, but without the work done here the Soromid bioship technology will never evolve.</description>
   <bar>Wigheta's spaceport bar is located close to the actual landing docks of the spaceport. The research done on Wigheta is top-secret, so every precaution is being taken to prevent visitors from wandering into places they shouldn't.</bar>

   <description>Almost anyone who seeks to travel from Dvaered to Soromid space, or the other way around, stops by Wildwood on the way. It's a long haul, and Wildwood is one of the sparse providers of refuel along the route. While mainly a commercially oriented installation, Wildwood is also home to a small Soromid military outpost. The ships stationed here provide a bare minimum of protection to the traffic that passes through the system.</description>
   <bar>Ships need fuel, and so do their captains. Wildwood's spacedock bar, though modest, offers captains stopping by a respectable choice in beverages and pastimes before they have to move on.</bar>

   <description>Yrina is a resource world that's being strip-mined by the Sirii. The climate is harsh and almost all of the planet's surface is frozen, but in some cases that is actually desirable, as substances that would normally be fluid are now solid, and therefore mined more easily. Yrina supplies mostly Aesir, but some of the more exotic elements are exported to other perts of Sirius space, and beyond.</description>
   <bar>The bar has various displays that provide the patrons with details about the mining process, and the current state of the operation in various areas. Though to most visitors it is of passing interest at best, you've got to at least hand it to the Sirius that they take an informative approach to their operation here.</bar>

   <description>Zabween is an old station. It was first created as an outpost to fight piracy, but with the destruction of the Haven it has settled into a more traditional role. It presently functions as a largely commercial station, trading in many commodities. It keeps a museum with all sorts of ships and weapons that were used in the final fight against Haven.</description>
   <bar>The bar walls are decorated with pictures of Empire soldiers who have fallen in the fight against Haven and piracy in general. It has become customary for the Empire to post pictures of the fallen, honouring those who gave their lives protecting the Empire's ideals. They are working on another addition to be able to fit more pictures.</bar>

   <description>Zembla Shakar is like a resort for the elite within the Shakar system. The people who live here live on gigantic estates that they usually haven't seen all of. Most of the planet is off-limits to offworlders, and most traffic to the planet consists of import luxury goods and export waste products.</description>
   <bar>The bar is where traders wait until their cargo is loaded and unloaded. Pilots who come here expecting a glimpse of the rich lands that cover the surface of the planet will be disappointed, as there is very little to see here.</bar>

   <description>Most of Zeo's inhabitation is recently new. After the Incident, real estate prices had a major overhaul all across the galaxy, and the once neglected backwater world of Zeo quickly became prime land to settle for Imperial citizens. Though the population is still on the low side compared to older civilian worlds, the number of people living here rises by the day.</description>
   <bar>Because of Zeo's abrupt rise in value after the Incident, the antiquated facilities at the time had to be replaced to handle the influx of Imperial colonists. As a result, most of the infrastructure here is relatively modern. You won't find anything out of order or slow to respond in this bar.</bar>

   <description>Zepei has a modest native population, and a sizeable non-permanent population. The surface of the planet is covered with holiday resorts, nature parks and outdoor sports areas. Most of the vacation goers are Soromid. Non-modified humans would find the recreational activities too rough for comfort.</description>
   <bar>The spaceport bar is not frequented much. The Soromid who come here on vacation typically go straight to the terminals, and they constitute most of the spaceport's traffic. The bar is used only by the captains of the supply and trade ships that land on Zeppei.</bar>

   <description>Zhiru was once home to Eduard Manuel Goddard, the man who single-handedly designed the then-revolutionary Goddard battlecruiser, and who would establish the minor House Goddard. Now Zhiru has a booming spacecraft industry, specialized in the creation and maintenance of the Goddard ships. This is all possible due to the weak gravity and atmosphere that envelops Zhiru, which allows the massive spacecraft to land and take off with little difficulty.</description>
   <bar>The Goddard Bar is, unsurprisingly, an obsolete model of their eponymous ship, stripped and refitted in the form of a bar. It's surprisingly comfortable and cozy as a bar, although every so often you can hear creaking in the ancient metal frame.</bar>
