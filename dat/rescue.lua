   Rescue script for stranded pilots.

   The basic structure is as follows:

      If the player lacks any core outfits, either:

         a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
         b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults

      If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:

         a) Remove all non-cores
         b) Remove weapons, utility, or sructure outfits separately
         b) Replace cores with defaults

      There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
      in its default state already generates warnings on load.

   This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
   stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
   or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.

   The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
   of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
   final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

   Determines whether the player is stranded.

   In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
   and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.

   If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
   equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.

   The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
   player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.

   From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
   consisting of the player's inventory, plus:

      a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
      b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock

   At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:

      1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
      2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
            and no other suitable core outfits are available.
