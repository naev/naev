Gameplay tip messages.
ALL NPCs have a chance to say one of these lines instead of a lore message.
So, make sure the tips are always faction neutral.

   _([["Many factions offer rehabilitation programs to criminals through the mission computer, giving them a chance to get back into their good graces. It can get really expensive for serious offenders though!"]]),
   _([["These new-fangled missile systems! You can't even fire them unless you get a target lock first! But the same thing goes for your opponents. You can actually make it harder for them to lock on to your ship by equipping scramblers or jammers. Scout class ships are also harder to target."]]),
   --_([["You know how you can't change your ship or your equipment on some planets? Well, it seems you need an outfitter to change equipment, and a shipyard to change ships! Bet you didn't know that."]]),
   _([["Are you trading commodities? You can hold down #bctrl#0 to buy 50 of them at a time, and #bshift#0 to buy 100. And if you press them both at once, you can buy 500 at a time! You can actually do that with outfits too, but why would you want to buy 50 laser cannons?"]]),

   _([["There are passive outfits and active outfits. The passive ones modify your ship continuously, but the active ones only work if you turn them on. You usually can't keep an active outfit on all the time, so you need to be careful only to use it when you need it."]]),
   _([["If you're new to the galaxy, I recommend you buy a map or two. It can make exploration a bit easier."]]),

Turns out you can't disable the return to normal speed entirely, but you can control what amount of danger triggers it. Really handy if you want to ignore enemies that aren't actually hitting you."]]),
   _([["Flying bigger ships is awesome, but it's a bit tougher than flying smaller ships. There's so much more you have to do for the same actions, time just seems to fly by faster. I guess the upside of that is that you don't notice how slow your ship is as much."]]),
   _([["I know it can be tempting to fly the big and powerful ships, but don't underestimate smaller ones! Given their simpler designs and lesser crew size, you have a lot more time to react with a smaller vessel. Some are even so simple to pilot that time seems to slow down all around you!"]]),

   _([["Different ships should be built and piloted differently. One of the hardest lessons I learned as a pilot was to stop worrying so much about the damage my ship was taking in battle while piloting a large ship. These ships are too slow for dodging, not to mention so complicated that they reduce your reaction time, so you need to learn to just take the hits and focus your attention on firing back at your enemies."]]),
   _([["Remember that when you pilot a big ship, you perceive time passing a lot faster than you do when you pilot a small ship. It can be easy to forget just how slow these larger ships are when you're frantically trying to depressurize the exhaust valve while also configuring the capacitance array. In a way the slow speed of the ship becomes a pretty huge relief!"]]),
   _([["There's always an exception to the rule, but I wouldn't recommend using forward-facing weapons on larger ships. Large ships' slower turn rates aren't able to keep up with the dashing and dodging of smaller ships, and aiming is harder anyway what with how complex these ships are. Turrets are much better; they aim automatically and usually do a very good job!"]]),
   _([["Did you know that turrets' automatic tracking of targets is slowed down by cloaking? Well, now you do! Small ships majorly benefit from a scrambler or two; it makes it much easier to dodge those turrets on the larger ships."]]),
   _([["Don't forget to have your target selected. Even if you have forward-facing weapons, the weapons will swivel a bit to track your target. But it's absolutely essential for turreted weapons."]]),
   _([["Did you know that you can automatically follow pilot with Autonav? It's true! Just #bleft-click#0 the pilot to target them and then #bright-click#0 your target to follow! I like to use this feature for escort missions. It makes them a lot less tedious."]]),
   _([["The new aiming helper feature is awesome! Simply turn it on in your ship's weapons configuration and you get little guides telling you where you should aim to hit your target! I use it a lot."]]),
   _([["The '¤' symbol is the official galactic symbol for credits. Supposedly it comes from the currency symbol of an ancient Earth civilization. It's sometimes expressed with SI prefixes: 'k¤' for thousands of credits, 'M¤' for millions of credits, and so on."]]),
   _([["If you're piloting a medium ship, I'd recommend you invest in at least one turreted missile launcher. I had a close call a few decaperiods ago where a bomber nearly blew me to bits outside the range of my Laser Turrets. Luckily I just barely managed to escape to a nearby planet so I could escape the pilot. I've not had that problem ever since I equipped a turreted missile launcher."]]),
