 <description>The Sting Type II reworks the shield systems of the original model. By rerouting the capacitor recharge loop in a positive feedback loop, regeneration capabilities are significantly increased, at the cost of diminished total shield capacity. The resulting modification results in a ship that is suprisingly robust as long as shields are up, however, the moment they go down the hull tends to fail shortly after.</description>
