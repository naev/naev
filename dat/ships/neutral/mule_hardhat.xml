 <description>Specially ordered by the Mining Vrata, the Mule Hardhat is a modified version of the Mule with a focus on augmenting the mining capabilities. In particular, the hull has been significantly reinforced to be able to withstand occasional collisions with asteroids. A built-in asteroid scanner, in addition to specialized asteroid processing equipment has made it quite popular among miners. However, such changes come with an increase in the fabrication cost.</description>
