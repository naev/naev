 <description>With the Shark ΨIIIa, Nexus Shipyards rethinks the Shark as a Scout-class vessel. The weapon mounts are significantly reduced in exchange for more utility. However, unlike most scout ships, it still retains the durability, allowing it to play a more combat-focused reconnaissance role. For reasons unknown, there has been almost no publicity regarding the ΨIIIa and it is very hard to find.</description>
