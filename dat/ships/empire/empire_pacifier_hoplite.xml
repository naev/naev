 <description>Designed by an Imperial Combat Bureaucrat for personal use, the Pacifier Hoplite was in design limbo for over 50 cycles before it was finally approved and produced by Nexus Shipyards. Sadly, the original Bureaucrat that designed it died before they were ever able to see it completed.

Instead of standard shield arrays, the ship design uses special flash capacitors that are able to store significantly more power, but as a means to this end, they were originally designed to be single-use. Some minor design improvements have since made it possible to recharge them once fully drained, however, it takes a long time for them to naturally recover. The recovery process can be accelerated by performing an active cooldown cycle.</description>
