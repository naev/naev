 <description>Standard Empire Admonishers are fabricated to be able to fit many needs, in a one-size fits all approach. However, there are times when such flexibility can wind up being instead a limitation. The Longbow drastically changes how the Admonisher performs in combat by specializing in long-range attacks. A complete revamp of the aiming circuitry makes it so that the detection capabilities directly translate into increased weapon range. Furthermore, the ship has changed the weapon mounts to allow equipping heavy weapons that are able to make full use of the new long range compatibilities. As a downside, the ship ends up having much more difficulties when trying to deal with enemy interceptors and fighters.</description>
