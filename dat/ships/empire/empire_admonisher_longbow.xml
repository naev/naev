 <description>Standard Empire Admonishers are fabricated to suit many needs, in a one-size-fits-all approach. However, there are times when such a focus on flexibility can wind up to be a liability. The Longbow reconfiguration drastically changes how the Admonisher performs in combat by specializing in long-range attacks. A complete revamp of the targeting system makes any improvement to the ship's sensors directly translate into increased weapon range. To make full use of those new capabilities, the weapon mounts have been reworked to support high-caliber weaponry. As a downside, the ship ends up having much more difficulty dealing with enemy interceptors and fighters.</description>
