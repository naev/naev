# Soromid signature ship modifiers

 - armour\_mod -10
 - ew\_hide +10

Bioship cortex are based on equivalent S&K hulls (more details in dat/outfits/bioships/generate.py).
These modifiers turns them into something between S&K combat armor and Nexus Stealth armor.

 - With skill Armor-1 (Bulky Abdomen, armor) and Armor-3 (Hard Shell, damage absorption), this armor can be made more combat-oriented, even better than S&K.
 - Independently, it can be made more stealth-oriented (even better than Stealth armor) with skill Stealth-4 (Silence).
 - Independently, the skill Misc-1 (Cargo Sacs) makes it for the impossibility of using cargo armor.

These modifiers are therefore an artificial mean to make the default bio-armor something "neutral" that is opened to be specialised with skills.

Note: The Copia has significant cargo bonuses, therefore it loses the stealth bonus.
