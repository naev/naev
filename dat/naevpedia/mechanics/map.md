# Map

The map can be opened by the <%= "#b"..naev.getKey("map").."#0" %> key and gives in-depth information about the explored universe.
By default, the map shows in-depth information including dominant faction of the systems, local system features, the nebula, and more.
What the map shows can be toggled with the different map modes.

## Autonav

When clicking on a system in the map, the shortest autonav route from the current position is selected.
The bold green line indicates the next jump, bold yellow lines indicate subsequent jumps you still have fuel for, and bold red lines indicate jumps you will no longer have enough fuel to perform.
By clicking the "Autonav" button at the bottom, you can directly start autonav and close the map.

If you wish to manually create a route, by holding the #bshift#0 key while clicking, you can add routes from your current selected system.
This allows you to manually create your autonav route as you wish.

## Notes

You can leave notes on the current selected system using the "Toggle Note" button at the bottom.
This lets you mark and write things about interesting systems you have explored or other local properties.
The information will be available whenever you open the map.
You can delete added notes by selecting the system and pressing the "Toggle Note" button again.

## Modes

The map offers several modes to explore all the information it offers.

The "Discovery" mode indicates if you still have things to find in a system, such as space objects, or jump points.
Systems that are marked in green are fully explored, and you can find nothing new with your current sensors.

The commodity modes show the absolute cost and relative price (trade) with respect to the current system on the map.
Both the cost mode and trade mode are available for all the standard commodities you can trade for.

Finally, the "Minimal Mode" button toggles a simplified view of the map, without all the overlays for easier interpretation.

## Find

The "Find" button at the button at the bottom can be used to find systems, space objects, outfits, or ships from text.
This will list all found partial matches in descending order of distance, and can be used to find things easily.
As an alternative, the [outfits](outfits) and [ships](ships) that you know about and their locations can also be explored on the Archives.
