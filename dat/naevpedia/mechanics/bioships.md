# Bioships

Bioships are a hybrid between man-made constructs and living animals, and are tamed and created by the [Soromid Tribes](lore/factions/soromid).
Unlike normal ships, bioships have built-in cores that grow stronger as the ship gains experience.
Experience is gained primarily through doing missions with the ship.
By gaining experience, a bio-ship will be able to increase its rank.
Other than improving the core outfits, ranks allow the ship to learn new skills and become significantly more powerful.

## Skills

Bioship skills, ranks, and other information can be seen from the #bInformation window#0, which can be opened with the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("info").."#0" %> key.
You can also reset the skills by using experience, although this can lower your rank.
