# Reputation

Reputation represents how well you are liked by each [faction](lore/factions).
Increasing your reputation with a specific faction can give you access to more of their [outfits](outfits), [ships](ships), and spaceports.
With sufficient reputation, a faction will see you as friendly, changing how their ships behave near you.
On the other hand, lowering your reputation can lead to a faction seeing you as an enemy, barring you from their spaceports and attacking you on sight.

Your reputation is on a per-system basis, however, neighbouring systems of the same faction will have a tendency to be similar.
By default, you will get a message whenever there is a reputation change, but you can modify this from the settings in the #binformation window#0 that you can open with the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("info").."#0" %> key.
Your current global reputation standings and other details of the different factions can also be seen from the #bInformation window#0.

## Changing Reputation

There are several ways to change your reputation with a faction:

1. [Doing missions](mechanics/missions)
1. Attacking, [boarding](mechanics/boarding), or destroying ships

Reputation changes will propagate to allies and enemies of the faction your reputation is changing with.
For example, although attacking a faction will decrease your standing with them, attacking an enemy of a faction will increase your standing with them.

## Reputation Limits

Each faction has a maximum level of reputation you can reach.
This maximum will be increased as you perform specific [missions](mechanics/missions) for the faction.
