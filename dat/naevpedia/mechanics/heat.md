# Heat

Most outfits generate heat when used.
They will heat up, and in turn, heat up the rest of the ship.
As the temperature goes up, weapons will become increasingly inaccurate and fire at a slower rate.
Weapons become more inaccurate at over 500 K and have lower fire rate at over 1,100 K.

## Active Cooldown

Although ships cool down naturally through radiation of excess heat, they can perform an active cooldown manoeuvre to dump all excess heat in a short amount of time.
Not only does it get rid of all excess heat, but it will also reload all weapons on the ship.
The downside is the ship will be immovable and unable to defend itself during this time.
An active cooldown can be performed by either double tapping the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("reverse").."#0" %> key or by pressing the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("cooldown").."#0" %> key.
The amount of time it takes to do an active cooldown depends on both the mass of the ship and the amount of excess heat.
