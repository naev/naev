# Hailing

Communicating with ships or spaceports can be a good way to request assistance, discourage them from attacking your ship through bribing, or even obtaining information.
You can hail ships in space using the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("hail").."#0" %> key.
Additionally, some ships will hail your ship.
You can respond to these ships by either targetting them and hailing them, or using the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("autohail").."#0" %> key to respond directly.

## Requesting Fuel

When you run out of [fuel](mechanics/hyperspace), some good samaritans will offer to refuel you, usually in exchange for credits.
If you hail a pilot when you are out of fuel, the option will appear, and you can negotiate to get your ship refueled.

## Bribing

When dealing with hostile ships, you are sometimes able to bribe them and their companions.
By hailing them, you will get an option to bribe them and also all their fleet members.
After you make the payment, the hostile ships will turn neutral and leave you alone.
Do note that if you make them angry again, it is likely they will be not as kind as before.
