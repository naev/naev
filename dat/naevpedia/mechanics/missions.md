# Missions

Many different factions and individuals will offer you missions where you can help them in exchange for rewards.
Although missions can be offered in many forms, such as by [hailing ships](mechanics/hailing), or [boarding](mechanics/boarding) derelicts, most missions you will come across will be offered either from the Mission Bulletin Board System or the Spaceport Bar.

## Mission Bulletin Board System

Although not available on all spaceports, the Mission Bullet Board System is the fastest way to find missions to do.
All available missions will be directly listed with all details, including rewards, in each posting.
Missions can also be sorted and filtered via the gear button in the top right.

Doing missions for factions is both a good way to make [credits](mechanics/credits) and to increase your [reputation](mechanics/reputation).

## Spaceport Bar

All sorts of characters will pop up in the Spaceport Bar, from locals who may give you hints or tips, to people who have jobs or services for you.
Particularly important characters will have a red exclamation mark at the top and appear at the beginning of the bar.
Additionally, if there is an important character, the bar tab will have red exclamation marks highlighting it.
Helping characters is a good way to access new things and make yourself known in the universe.
