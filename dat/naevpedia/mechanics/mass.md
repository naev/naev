# Mass

Mass plays an important role for a ship's [movement](mechanics/movement) and [electronic warfare](mechanics/ewarfare).
All ships have an inherent mass that is increased by outfits and cargo.
As the mass increases, a ship's [visibility and signature](mechanics/ewarfare) will increase, making it easier to detect and attack.
Furthermore, ships have a mass limit, determined by the core engine.
If the ship's mass surpasses the mass limit, it will suffer penalties to [movement](mechanics/movement).
