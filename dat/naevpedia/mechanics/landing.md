# Landing

Landing on spaceports is one of the fundamental activities you will do while exploring the universe.

## Landing Window

The first window you will be greeted by.
It contains a description of the spaceport, and some properties of the place you are visited.
In most spaceports you can also buy a local map and refuel your ship.
The services offered by the spaceport will vary significantly.

### Spaceport Bar

The best place to meet other individuals.
Not only will you be able to chat with the locals, you will also meet other individuals who may offer you missions or other things.
Important individuals will be marked with an exclamation point.
Furthermore, the tab will be marked with two exclamation points if an important individual is at the spaceport bar.

### Missions

The Mission Bullet Board System is where you can accept a diversity of different missions.
The missions offered there are usually a good way to make additional credits or increase your reputation with different factions.
You can filter the missions based on their legal status, and also sort them based on different properties such as rewards.

### Outfits

At the outfitter, you are able to buy locally available outfits, and also sell any outfit you have.
The availability of outfits depends on the location.
You can hold #bshift#0 and #bcontrol#0 to increase the amount of outfits you buy or sell at a time.

All the outfits you know and their availability can be accessed [here](outfits).

### Shipyard

Ships can be purchased at the shipyard.
You have either the option to buy a new ship, or trade in your current ship when buying a new one.
The new ship will be available at the equipment tab for use after purchase.

All the ships you know and their availability can be accessed [here](ships).

### Equipment

Any spaceport with refuelling capabilities will allow you to access the [equipment tab](mechanics/equipment).
Here you can change the outfits on your ships, or change your current ship.
<% if player.fleetCapacity() > 0 then %>
By right-clicking on ships, or toggling the #bdeployed#0 checkbox, you can set a ship as part of [your player fleet](mechanics/playerfleet).
<% end %>

You can click on the slots of the selecting ship to filter only the outfits that go in the slot.
Right-clicking on a slot will remove an outfit, while right-clicking on an outfit will add it to the slot.
You can use the tabs and the outfit filter to further control what outfits are visible.

### Commodity Exchange

Here you can buy or sell commodities.
The price will depend on the location, which you can compare on [the universe map](mechanics/map).
By buying low and selling high, you can turn quite a profit.
Similarly to the outfitter, you can hold #bshift#0 and #bcontrol#0 to increase the amount of commodities you buy or sell at a time.
