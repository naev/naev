# Great House Dvaered

House Dvaered is one of the Great Houses of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire).
It evolved from the working class of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) during the [Second Growth and the Faction Wars](lore/history) and was granted the status of a Great House by the Emperor during the Golden Age of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire).
Today, it is governed by the military and the armed forces dominate much of the everyday lives of the Dvaered citizens.
Planets are governed by Warlords, former members of the Dvaered High Command, which makes all the most important decisions about the House.
The Warlords regulate life on a local basis, while the High Command directs the Faction as a whole.
The only way of rising up is through military achievement, recognized through medals and commendations.

## History

House Dvaered came forth from a lower caste in the old Empire, a collection of miners, manual labourers, foot soldiers, and outcasts.
With the gradual decline in authority of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire), the working class became increasingly disgruntled with their social position.
They banded together into what could be considered the biggest labour union in all of human history, and started demanding better treatment.

When [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) was less than forthcoming, the labourers began to take more drastic measures.
The peaceful labour union demands turned into an armed resistance movement that escalated into open rebellion on several worlds.
History names this movement the Dvaered Revolts.
While the origin of that name is lost to time, it became a badge of honour among the rebelling workers.

Cycles of civil unrest on the working planets and fruitless attempts on the part of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) to quell it eventually led the Emperor to agree to the Dvaereds' demands.
Their leaders were granted the right to establish a Great House, and direct control over a sizeable chunk of space, in reparation for the lives lost during the Dvaered Revolts.

Eager to claim their place among the other big players, the Dvaered leadership decided that discipline was the most effective way to shape a society.
House Dvaered became a military regime, and the values of honour, strength, and discipline were etched into the Dvaered soul.

## Government

Today, House Dvaered is ruled by the Generals of Dvaered High Command.
The amount of Generals varies from time to time, but there are always enough to feed the fires of internal discord.
Influence is usually determined by the amount of medals and commendations a General has collected in their career.
This stands undisputed, for House Dvaered has meticulous protocols for dispensing awards and commendations.
In fact, it is the one thing universally agreed upon and honoured in Dvaered society.

### Warlords

When a General retires from High Command, they often take with them a small contingent of the armed forces.
These are soldiers and sailors have sworn allegiance to the person, not the banner, and they will continue to serve until the bitter end.
The General, now known as a Warlord, will then use their private military to secure rule over one or more Dvaered worlds, usually by usurping the position from another Warlord.
This method of local government is commonly accepted, and no Dvaered citizen will be surprised when suddenly a new set of local laws will be passed.

### Citizens

The Dvaered citizenry itself is barely worthy of the name.
There is often more squalor than culture, with military employment being seen as necessary and expected.
For those citizens that are unable to join the military, Dvaered society is exceptionally harsh, often condemning these individuals to working for barely livible wages in barely acceptable conditions.
Nevertheless, there certainly is a Dvaered elite.
They often concentrate on the few truly hospitable worlds in Dvaered space, where they pursue their idea of luxury.

### Warlords and Dvaered High Command

While every Dvaered controlled world is governed by a Warlord at any given time, it is Dvaered High Command that the Warlords ultimately answer to.
Though Dvaered High Command is more military than government, it needs a steady stream of funds, manpower and materials to further its agenda.
Each Warlord is required to pay a certain portion of their worlds' resources in tax.
Failure to do so results in a swift and permanent removal by Dvaered High Command, after which the worlds previously held by that warlord become available to any other Warlords with the will to take them (which is to say, all of them).
