  <description>Omar's planetary conditions lend it particularly well to the extraction of many common metals. Dvaered High Command has licenced a local enterprise to set up a weapons and munitions factory here.</description>
  <bar>First time visitors are always taken aback when they enter this spaceport bar. The centre of the room is occupied by a real, actual Mass Driver cannon, and it's pointing straight at the door. Local rumour has it that the cannon is loaded and powered at all times, and that the bar's proprietor uses it to discourage people from misbehaving in his bar.</bar>
