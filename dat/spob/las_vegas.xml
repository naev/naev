  <description>Originally a calm and quiet prosperous M-class world, it has become another planet devastated by the Incident. Not only was the entire atmosphere scrubbed off by the Nebula, the brute force of the impact fractured the planet's surface, exposing and cooling the once molten core, leaving no opportunity for any forms of life to survive. Although invisible to the naked eye, your ship's advanced sensors are able to make out faint traces of once bustling cities on the planet's surface.</description>
