  <description>All of the Empire's military cadets end up having a mandatory stay at Gamma Enclave. Although not luxurious by any standard, it is well organized and designed for dealing with large numbers of personnel. The station is well equipped for organizing in-system exercises with in-depth visualizations of everything that is happening locally.
Although the space docks are not large enough to allow for ship construction, the station is also well suited for making adjustments and repairs on even the largest of Empire vessels.</description>
  <bar>Due to the ever changing staff rosters on the station, the bar has a very casual atmosphere, so it's very easy to meet new people. There's a wall of shame and wall of glory where visualizations of horrible mishaps and glorious feats are highlighted for everyone to see. The drinks flow generously fueled by military paychecks and it is not uncommon to see novices passed out.</bar>
