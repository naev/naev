  <description>Fort Raglan is the Dvaereds' single most visible presence in Frontier space. Officially, the station is a mixture of a trade station and an embassy for Dvaered citizens, but it is public knowledge that the Dvaered use the base as a stronghold in their fight against the FLF, and many Frontier inhabitants fear that in time it will also be the staging point for the Dvaered invasion of the Frontier.</description>
  <bar>The Raglan bar is a utilitarian affair, quite small and nearly empty. Though Dvaereds do like to drink, all outpost personnel are under standing orders to remain on alert, given the threat of FLF attack.</bar>
