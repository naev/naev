  <description>Culex is the moon of planet Myonei. Myonei itself is a factory world, but it's too unpleasant for even the genetically altered Soromid to live on. Fortunately, Culex is quite suitable for habitation and so the workers who labour on the surface have their homes here. Culex is little more than a habitat with no economy of its own. It's fairly uninteresting to most people who don't actually live here.</description>
  <bar>As Culex sees little traffic other than commuters to and from Myonei, the spaceport bar has been repurposed as a community centre by the locals. The standard facilities are still present and operational but in a minimal fashion. Most of the facility is filled with recreational facilities and even a dance floor.</bar>
