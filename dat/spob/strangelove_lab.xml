  <description>The laboratory is concealed on an asteroid with all the infrastructure located underground. Inside, a network of dusty tunnels connects the different facilities, and put all together, the insides seem to be smaller than that of a medium-sized ship. It is incredible that anyone could survive, let alone live here.</description>
  <bar>The recreation room of the laboratory has piles of research equipment gathering dust in the corners. There seems to be also poorly refrigerated biological samples that you wouldn't be surprised if they moved. The only recreational things you can find are a chessboard that is missing about a dozen pieces and bottles of ethanol which you probably shouldn't be drinking.</bar>
