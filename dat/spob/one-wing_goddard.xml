  <description>You dock with the remains of a once majestic Dvaered Goddard. The hull is covered in burns and war scars from countless of encounters during the time it was in service. It seems like the ship finally met its match with enormous holes throughout the structure as a testament to its fate. Given that there doesn't seem to be many working parts left in the ship, or even a basic amount of structural integrity, you have to remain in your atmospheric suit throughout your visit to the ship.</description>
