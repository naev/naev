  <description>Cole Outpost is the last civilian station on the route to Doeston, and was constructed as part of a large post-Incident movement to try to recover territory from the Nebula. Many transport ships stop to refuel and regenerate their shields within, safely away from the brunt of the Nebula's radiation.
The station isn't well populated, and its inhabitants mainly make a living off servicing the ships going to and from the Nebula.</description>
