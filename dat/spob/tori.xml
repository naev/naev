  <description>When the thirteenth colony ship, Yamato Nadeshiko, arrived at Tori, it was sterile - in spite of the planet's abundant supply of both water and carbon. But the colonists' introduction of Earth flora was successful beyond expectations, and within a century the planet had acquired a fully functional ecosystem; today much of the world's surface is covered by nature, a state the inhabitants of Tori have maintained since.
Though Tori's economic potential remains largely untapped, the thriving tourist industry largely compensates.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport bar is more than just functional. Since most new arrivals on the planet come here first, the authorities have taken pains to make the bar appealing and comfortable. Of course, the fact that Tori is a tourist attraction also means drinks are quite expensive in this barâ€¦</bar>
