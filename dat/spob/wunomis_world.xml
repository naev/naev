  <description>Wunomi's World is an old world that was colonized early for its similarity with the now-gone Earth. However, unlike Earth, the governor wanted to keep the planet in a less developed state, conserving much of its natural fauna and beauty. Development was then taken to space, in which an enormous geostationary ring was built, known as Wunomi's Ring. Only few cities remain down on the surface, with much of the focus on managing tourism. Most of the population lives in the ring which has gotten slightly crowded with the Incident. However, Wunomi's World acts as an important local trade hub, and work is still plentiful due to a somewhat strict population control system designed to conserve the planet and by extension ring's characteristic nature.
As most of the population and cities are located on the ring instead of the planet, it is closer to a station than a planet. Low gravity allows for easy transpiration of bulk goods and encourages the sale of ships. For this reason, it is easy to find many supplies tailored for traders.</description>
  <bar>The bar has a unique design where you enter through small vertical glass elevator platforms directly from the Ring's main corridor. The room is designed as a concave glass dome facing the planet, which provides an incredible view of the splendor of Wunomi's World. Platforms with tables and sofas are suspended throughout, making it look like almost some boats floating at sea. Although confusing first, when you get used to it you begin to admire the architectural design and thought that went into bar.</bar>
