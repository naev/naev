  <description>The first known ringworld constructed by humanity, Barnard's Star Ringworld boasted to almost a billion inhabitants at its peak. With a diversity of ecosystems supported by the artificial gravity, it was lauded as one of humanity's major accomplishments in megastructure engineering. Although the construction took over 30 cycles, it only took the explosion generated by the Incident an instant to completely blast away the atmosphere, fracture the structure, and condemn those who survived to a slow suffocation in the vacuum of space.
No longer composed of a single connected ring, exploring the structure is very time-consuming as it requires many complicated zero-g suit manoeuvres. As most of the structure has been picked clean of anything of value by many scavengers and artefact hunters, there is not much reason to search the structure either way.</description>
