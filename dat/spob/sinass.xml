  <description>Despite being a fairly typical civilian Sirius world where Sirii of all echolons make their home, Sinass stands out for having some of the best civilian academies. It is common for highly educated Sirii to make the choice between a military career and study at the Socrates Academy Monastery, or focus on civilian applications by studying at Sinass. Additionally, Sinass provides most of the supplies needed by Sirius Monastery, ensuring the stability of thy system.</description>
  <bar>This bar is divided into three sections. One is blue, one is green and the other is purple. It seems to have some significance, but nobody seems to know exactly what it is. The locals get very upset when you're sitting in the wrong section, though.</bar>
