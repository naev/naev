  <description>Grindstone Shipyards is a private manufacturing plant owned by Titus Grindstone, a wealthy Fyrra Sirian who has moved into the spaceship business. He is licensed to manufacture some of the more common civilian models, and his factory supplies a fair number of the surrounding retailers. Ships can also be purchased directly from this station.
Although originally distributing ships to both the Empire and House Sirius, with the trade lane now cut off, it focuses entirely on the Sirius market, also producing House Sirius ships.</description>
  <bar>Titus Grindstone likes to keep his potential customers in a good mood, which is why he has invested into a small yet luxurious spacedock bar on his manufacturing plant. It sports all the standard bar facilities, as well as ready access to the station's ship catalogue.</bar>
