  <description>Koga has a highly active crust, and many describe the surface as being a reasonable facsimile of hell. They may not be too far off the mark, as lava flows and sudden rumbles from the earth are quite common. Although most of the planet is unsuitable for construction, there is a small area at the south pole that is reasonably stable, by Koga standards, allowing for people to live.</description>
  <bar>The bar has holovids and pictures of the more spectacular activity of Koga's turbulent geography. The bar is known for the "Lava Storm" drink, which you need to sign a waiver to drink.</bar>
