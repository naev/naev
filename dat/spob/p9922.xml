  <description>Over the course of time, the planet seems to have synchronized with the plasma storm and now almost looks to be an extension of it. The surface is a more or less constant flux of hot plasma arcing to and from space. You are able to find a small outcropping to land on that is mostly safe from the chaotic atmospheric fury, but it's probably best not to idle here.</description>
