  <description>Although designated as a emergency source of water by House Za'lek, WSTHVN P-1 has never yet had to be used in such ways. It's not clear how the planet developed, but it seems to consist of a small ultra-dense core covered in hundreds of kilometers of ice. Za'lek scientists speculate that the ice is of xtraterrestrial origin, likely accumulated from stray nearby asteroids or some other eccentric phenomena.

Except for the odd PhD student or post-doc coming to try to do research, it is mainly visited by individuals coming from Thaddius Terminals, although it is not entirely clear what they are doing here.</description>
