  <description>A bit of an odd planet, Zaals has a rotational period almost (but not quite) identical to its orbital period. One day on Zaals lasts many, many cycles. The Soromid habitation here has been built on the side facing the sun, where conditions are still acceptable. It's actually the second iteration of the settlement, as the first iteration has begun to slip into the dark side. The current settlement is predicted to stay in the light for another forty cycles.</description>
  <bar>This spaceport bar offers excursions to the old, abandoned spaceport that's in the twilight zone of the planet. To some adventurous types it can be quite thrilling to roam around such a large complex that has been completely left to the elements.</bar>
