  <description>As a resource for many common building materials, Stella is a busy yet fairly squalid world. Planets like these crop up in most interplanetary economies, a sad but inevitable phenomenon. Life here is rough and unforgiving, and nobody comes here because they like to.</description>
  <bar>It's not much fun living on a world like Stella. Few people can stay cheerful after living here for any appreciable amount of time. This spaceport bar attempts to lift spirits with a plaque over the bar that reads "A better tomorrow for all". It doesn't help any.</bar>
