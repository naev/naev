  <description>An atmosphere-less amalgam of rock, likely created by a concentration of asteroids that ended up reaching enough of a mass to become stable with its own gravitational pull. While there are probably rare resources under the planet's mantle, they're likely more easily obtained from the nearby asteroid fields that originally gave birth to this planet.</description>
