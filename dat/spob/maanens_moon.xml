  <description>Maanen's Moon was just beyond the effect of the Incident and, finding itself on a major evacuation route, ended up becoming a hotspot for refugees - a circumstance that has seriously affected the planet's future.
Following the Incident, many damaged refugee ships arrived on Maanen's Moon; while the most spaceworthy pressed on, large numbers stayed behind for emergency repairs. But the material needed to repair ships soon ran out and the moon did not have the housing to hold so many refugees, so many of the vessels that remained on the planet were converted into temporary dwellings to house the massively-increased population.
As local supplies ran dry and the prospect of more supplies unlikely given the disarray of the Imperial government, the local Imperial Governor declared a state of emergency that is still in effect today. Despite a relative stabilization of events and humanitarian aid from organizations such as the Red Star, famine and plague continues to devastate the planet.</description>
  <bar>Given that few ships wish to land on Maanen's Moon, and exacerbated by the fact that even fewer are given clearance, the spaceport bar has few patrons. Most of them are Imperial bureaucrats and military personal who are forced to live here to try to keep control of the population; among the faces here, there is an almost universal look of desperation to leave this planet.</bar>
