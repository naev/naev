  <description>Fort Voproid is a center for training the physical and especially mental attributes of new recruits. It has a very classic design with little clutter and large rooms, which is very uncommon in space station designs due to the low efficiency. A third of the entire fort is dedicated to meditation rooms that are routinely visited by commanders and new recruits alike. Until one gets used to the layout of the station it is very common to suffer from frequent disorientation.</description>
  <bar>The bar follows the same minimalistic aesthetics of the rest of the station, feeling closer to a center of meditation rather than a crowded space bar. Most of the beverages provided have no alcohol and are designed to boost the mental prowess.</bar>
