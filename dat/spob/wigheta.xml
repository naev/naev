  <description>While the main line of Soromid military ship production is located on Heronus in Uridhrion, there is a secondary ship plant here on Wigheta. Wigheta does not grow the regular models, however. Instead, the world acts as a research facility for bioships, where new designs and growth methods are invented and tested. It's a slow and expensive process, and Wigheta only produces a useful result once every few cycles, but without the work done here the Soromid bioship technology will never evolve.</description>
  <bar>Wigheta's spaceport bar is located very close to the actual landing docks of the spaceport. The research done on Wigheta is top-secret, so every precaution is being taken to prevent visitors from wandering into places they shouldn't.</bar>
