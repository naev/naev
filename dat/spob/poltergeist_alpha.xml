  <description>Likely the result of a fairly recent collision of multiple large astral bodies, Poltergeist Alpha has a highly unstable radioactive that is constantly releasing radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere. The young planet is considered highly toxic by any of the different scales used throughout the Empire, and can prove to be a real test of a ship's shielding capabilities. It is probably best not to tarry too long within range of the radiation.</description>
