  <description>This cold, dead, rocky world was named after the man who settled the colony here, an entrepreneur by the name of Shaan Vargo. Vargo was convinced that this planet harboured untold wealth in precious metals and minerals deep underneath its surface. He persisted in his belief right up until his death in the Incident but the miners here never found anything. What they did find was fairly average, which at least sell well enough to keep the colony marginally profitable.</description>
  <bar>Miner bars are miner bars the galaxy over, but Sirian miner bars distinguish themselves by incorporating the typical Sirian spirituality into the down-to-earth-and-lower nature of a mining colony. Miners frequently come above ground to perform their religious ceremonies, and so are less prone to the stress and mental trauma that a prolonged stay in a mine can cause.</bar>
