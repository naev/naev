  <description>The planet Aldous is a giant sea of a fluid toxic to humans. Even the tiniest exposure to the toxic material in Aldous' ocean is lethal. As far as habitability is concerned, planets like this one come in dead last on the list. Nevertheless, a handful of brave souls have chosen to make this planet their home. The ocean may be toxic, but it also happens to be the perfect environment for producing high quality positronic circuitry.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport facility is part of a larger structure that houses the entirety of this planet's human inhabitants. The complex, more or less, floats on the surface and is tightly sealed against the outside environment. Furthermore, the complex is highly compartmentalized, in case a leak somehow occurs. Some spacers even insist on wearing breathing masks, even in the spaceport bar, just to be on the safe side.</bar>
