  <description>Benteen has become one of the Empire's primary agriworlds, growing most of the crops that are bound for the quickly developing western systems. It is a quiet world, with little in the way of the bustle and fuss of other coreward planets.
It is not uncommon for people to migrate here looking for a calmer lifestyle, away from the chaos and people near the major trade lanes.</description>
  <bar>The bar is a place to relax after a long trip or a hard day's work. The beer is fine and the locals seem friendly enough. Mostly harmless.</bar>
