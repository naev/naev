  <description>Part of the reason why Warei's surface is permanently frozen is because the planet's core is cold. This is a fascinating aberration from the standard planetary model but, more than that, it offers great economic possibilities as there are vast amounts of raw minerals to be had under the crust. The Soromid have set up a parts and ship manufacturing complex here.</description>
  <bar>Even the Soromid need protection from the cold climate, but they're certainly more resistant to it than normal humans. Most non-Soromid traders visiting Warei complain about the cold - the ambient temperature in the bar is far from comfortable.</bar>
