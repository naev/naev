  <description>Ammu is a generally calm planet, once one is accustomed to the constant rumbling of the lava flows. Lava eruptions are often felt in the subterranean spaceport, but the way it doesn't seem to faze the locals reassures you. The lava does have a more positive aspect in attracting industries that need high pressure and temperature to function effectively, but the climate makes Ammu dependent on nearby planets such as Reidd for food supplies.</description>
  <bar>The Ammu Spaceport Bar, known as "The Heatsink" due to its frigid temperatures, is a contrast to the rest of the station, although on most planets it would be considered fairly warm. While primarily known for its temperature, that's not to say you can't get a mean Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.</bar>
