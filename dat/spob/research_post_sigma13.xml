  <description>You see what looks like was once a small Za'lek research station. While the inside is largely intact, there are large plasma scars all over the hull of the station. There are also large amounts of structural damage which are likely the result of a collision with a large object. A brief inspection of the inside makes it clear that there is no life remaining on the station. The spaceport dock also has a small shipyard that seems to be unusable from all the destruction. However, what is strangest of all the things you find on the station is the puzzling fact that the fuel has been taken through a large hole in the exteriorâ€¦</description>
