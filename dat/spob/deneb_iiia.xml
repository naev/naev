  <description>Originally a moon of Deneb III, Deneb III-a seems to have been blown off-orbit and is now a rogue planet, likely to leave the system in the next few hundred cycles. The surface of the planet seems heavily damaged, with odd crystalline formations here and there, likely from some sort of reaction with the Nebula.</description>
