  <description>Erebus Enclave was established during the Dvaered revolts to enforce their military presence in the area and prevent the revolts from reaching further into Empire space.
Although House Dvaered has been formally recognized by the Empire and poses no imminent danger towards its space, Erebus Enclave remains in use as an active military installation to monitor Dvaered movements. But after the Incident, it has also served a secondary function to keep taps the situation on Majesteka II, so that it does not devolve into something more dangerous.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport bar has not deviated one bit from the standard issue set-up for Imperial stations. A diligent staff keeps it in tip-top shape. While it is enjoyable, it fails to make an impression on you and you will probably forget immediately upon leaving the station.</bar>
