  <description>Erebus Terminal was established during the Dvaered revolts to enforce the military presence in the area and prevent them from extending to the rest of the Empire. Although now with House Dvaered being formally recognized there is no imminent danger from the Dvaered, Erebus Terminal remains in use as an active military station. However, more than keeping an eye out on the Dvaered, it is used to keep tabs on the refugee issue at Majesteka II to make sure it does not devolve into something more dangerous.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport bar has not deviated one bit from the standard issue set-up for Imperial stations. A diligent staff keeps it in tip-top shape. While it is enjoyable, it fails to make an impression on you and you will probably forget immediately upon leaving the station.</bar>
