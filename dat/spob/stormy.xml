  <description>This gas giant serves as a resource gathering and advanced atmospheric research node with stations dotting its orbit as low as is safe (and perhaps a bit lower than that). The facilities here are frequently used in the construction of advanced beam weaponry, allowing a larger-than-usual presence of the Za'lek military.</description>
  <bar>This bar is significantly neater than most Za'lek spaceport bars. That is not to say it's orderly. The patrons are overwhelmingly gas miners, manufacturers and a few militia. The drinks glow suspiciously and the bartender smirks as you side-eye them.</bar>
