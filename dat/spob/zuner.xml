  <description>Zuner's surface has been dedicated almost entirely to crop growing. While there are some urban centres scattered around the world, their population is low compared to the residential megaplexes of more densely populated worlds. Though the community is, to a large extent, agricultural, the inhabitants are in no way out of touch with the rest of the galaxy and are, in fact, quite wealthy, due to how lucrative Zuner's choice of food production is.</description>
  <bar>Many spacers think of agricultural worlds as backwater places that lag way behind the rest of the galaxy. Sometimes, they are right, but not in the case of Zuner. The spaceport is as modern as can be and its bar wouldn't be out of place even in the Sirius core.</bar>
