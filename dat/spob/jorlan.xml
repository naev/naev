  <description>Jorlan is one of the least successful Frontier worlds. Its colony ship, Santa Maria, arrived to find a barren, desolate rock that had next to no potential for human inhabitants. But with the only other reachable planet being a gas giant, Santa Maria's captain was faced with the choice to settle or perish. Somehow, his expedition has managed to eke out an existence on Jorlan.
Jorlan's inhabitants are mostly part of the ore refining process, as it supplies most of the Frontier with all sorts of alloys. Gas miners are also sent to Haleb IV every few dozen decaperiods when the weather conditions are favourable.</description>
  <bar>Rather atypically for a heavy-industry world, the people of Jorlan don't really have a habit of drinking. You see numerous other spacefarers, but almost no natives.</bar>
