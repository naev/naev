  <description>The last bastion of Imperial control before entering Za'lek space, Outbound Enclave is meant to patrol and tax traffic between the Empire and its supposedly subservient great house. In theory, the system is owned by the Empire, but the Za'lek also maintains a strong presence here because of Gerhart Central, so the debate over who truly owns the Ganth system and its tolls is a tense one.</description>
  <bar>The bar is staffed with traders and Imperial Military officials. It is noteworthy that there is no Za'lek in sight here.</bar>
