  <description>Located on the fringes of Dvaered-controlled territory, Sudra has a relatively high amount of illegal activity going on. Though the Dvaered authorities actively try to stamp out criminal elements and make arrests almost every week, they are fighting a futile battle.</description>
  <bar>This spaceport bar is unsavoury. No other word will describe the place with the same accuracy. A good portion of the bar's clientele are wearing hoods, masks, or other garments to hide their personal features. The lighting is set to quite a dim level, allowing customers to find corners as dark as they please. Despite these obvious signs, the Dvaered officials that sometimes visit the bar don't seem very keen to investigate.</bar>
