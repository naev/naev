  <description>Covered in perpetually undulating sand, made dance by endless powerful storms, Merisi I is not a very comfortable stay. There seem to be traces of attempted structures, or maybe crash-wrecked ships on the surface, however, it is unlikely that they will ever be recoverable. You can not dally too long lest your ship join the others.</description>
