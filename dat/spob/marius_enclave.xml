  <description>Marius Enclave used to be a customs station of the old Empire, checking traffic bound for Sol and the core Imperial systems. Now, in the post-Incident era, the station had been first repurposed to handle those fleeing from the irradiated worlds and to serve as a first line of defence from anything that can come out of the Sol Nebula. But since it is perpetually under-staffed and under-equipped, Marius Enclave is barely capable of maintaining its own presence in Raelid, let alone protect or manage anything else.</description>
  <bar>This bar is self-service most of the time. All Empire personnel on board have their hands full with double shifts, repair duties and briefings. Few have the spare time to even visit the spacedock bar, let alone staff it.</bar>
