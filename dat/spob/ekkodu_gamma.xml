  <description>Ekkodu Gamma is a harsh world, battered by constant sandstorms that grind down most objects above the surface. It was originally designed as a forced mining camp when controlled by the Empire, and when passed over to House Dvaered, the tradition continued not only continued, but was expanded with criminals and other undesirables. When the Incident happened, to minimize the effect of refugees on their core worlds, incoming refugees were diverted in large numbers here, significantly increasing the population. Although initial attempts to keep the forced labourers and refugees were had, the situation quickly got out of control as large slums were carved out below the planet's surface for the increase in population. Life is hard on Ekkodu Gamma, with low expectations of improvement, with most inhabitants working in the mines throughout the planet.</description>
  <bar>Like almost all the constructions on the planet, the bar is located under the surface, just below the spaceport. It is a dusty and dirty place, quite crowded with people off their mining shifts. Drink covers are offered to try to minimize the ratio of sand-to-drink, however, quite a few of the locals have given up on such endeavour.</bar>
