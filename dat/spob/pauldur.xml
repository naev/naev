  <description>Although one may expect crime to be lower in a society where weak psychic powers are commonplace, the truth is that it is not much different from the rest of the galaxy. To accommodate the growing penal population, Pauldur was designed as a prison world given the difficulty of access and inhospitality. Although most the planet is inaccessible without high security clearance, the spaceport has modest accommodations for those who get lost or wish to visit their incarcerated relatives.</description>
