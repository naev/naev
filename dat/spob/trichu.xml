  <description>Trichu is both the base for a mining operation that extracts hydrogen from Adiadus IV and a manufacturing plant for low-level industrial goods. The goods are mostly consumed by other worlds in this system, but a small portion of it is exported abroad. Profit margins are minimal, but the facility at least manages to keep from going under.</description>
  <bar>By far, most patrons here are workers whose shifts have ended and whose transport home hasn't arrived yet. The rest are traders who are here to pick up goods.</bar>
