  <description>Almost anyone who seeks to travel from Dvaered to Soromid space, or the other way around, stops by Wildwood on the way. It's a long haul and Wildwood is one of the sparse providers of refueling along the route. While mainly a commercially oriented installation, Wildwood is also home to a small Soromid military outpost. The ships stationed here provide a bare minimum of protection to the traffic that passes through the system.</description>
  <bar>Ships need fuel, so do their captains. Wildwood's spacedock bar, though modest, offers visiting captains a respectable choice in beverages and pastimes before they have to move on.</bar>
