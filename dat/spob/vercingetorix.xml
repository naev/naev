  <description>Vercingetorix is mined for rare resources that the Dvaered need to keep their war machine running. Fittingly, the planet's atmosphere is as harsh as it gets on a class-X planet. The Dvaered primarily use convicts to do the mining here, as then the brutal casualty rate does not have to concern the 'true' Dvaered citizens.</description>
  <bar>The bar is completely filled with off-duty soldiers tasked with overseeing the prisoners in their mining duties. It must be an easy job, considering how relaxed most of them look. Then again, the planet's environment must do more to beat down the convicts than they ever could.</bar>
