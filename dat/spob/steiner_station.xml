  <description>Once a highly prosperous planet of the old Empire, Uhrabi-9 was tragically struck by a large asteroid; the subsequently unstable volcanic activity reduced the planet to a lifeless state.
Steiner was originally one of the satellites previously used by the people of Uhrabi-9, but following the loss of the planet Steiner expanded large enough to be classified as a station. It is now a popular tourist spot due to its proximity to Uhrabi-9.</description>
