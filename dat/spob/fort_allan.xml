  <description>Fort Allan was set up by a patrol sent out to explore the southern reaches of space. With the Incident and the regression of Imperial power, the soldiers were left behind to fend for themselves and set up the station from scrap and parts of their ships. It is now barely maintained by a small contingent of Dvaered soldiers and engineers for the use of traders.</description>
  <bar>Fort Allan does not have the resources for much but the bar looks decent enough, with clean facilities, decent food and strong drink. For its patrons it provides a small respite from the harsh galaxy.</bar>
