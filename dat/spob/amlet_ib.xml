  <description>Much denser than Amlet 1a, this moon of Amlet I has some insignificant mineral deposits near the core. There used to be a small mining operation, but it has long since been abandoned given the difficulty of operating in war, and the small yields. Now, most of House Yetmer's resources are obtained through imports or mining operations on Amletia.</description>
