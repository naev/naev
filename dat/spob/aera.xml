  <description>This gas giant is rich enough in valuable minerals that the Proteron decided to establish a mining colony. The minerals are extracted with OOA heat subduction, which coaxes them out of the planet's dangerous core and into the upper atmosphere where they can be safely collected. Spaceships are allowed to dock at one of the many orbiting collection stations.</description>
