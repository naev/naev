  <description>With nearly all the surface covered in an ocean of toxic sludge, there are few landable areas on Quai IIb. It doesn't seem like even the best hull coating will last too long if you bury your ship in the sludge. Good thing there is not much of an atmosphere, so you don't have to worry about the possibility of toxic rain. On the downside, the air is heavily contaminated with microparticles that will slowly melt your ship if you dawdle too long.</description>
