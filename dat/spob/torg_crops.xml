  <description>Torg Crops is a crop-growing station constructed by the Dvaered to avert a famine that threatened to erupt in the Torg and Doranthex systems some cycles ago. It's currently running at about 80% of its potential output, but since population figures have remained relatively stable recently it seems that the station won't need to be expanded anytime soon.</description>
  <bar>The spacedock bar here exclusively serves drinks that have been produced from the plants that are grown on-station. This means that while the drinks have all kinds of exotic colours, they all basically taste like cabbage.</bar>
