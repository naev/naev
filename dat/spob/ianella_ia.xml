  <description>The only moon of Ianella to have a landable surface, Ianella I-a would have been colonized by now if it had not been skimming the surface of Ianella I's ionosphere. Constant electrical storms and extreme static electricity would make living on Ianella I-a be a never ending cycle of repairing broken electrical components. Combined with the lack of atmosphere and necessity to have active life support systems, living on Ianella I-a would amount to never knowing when your life systems would fail, condemning you to slow suffocation.</description>
