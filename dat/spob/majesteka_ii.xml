  <description>Majesteka II was originally planned for terraforming by the Empire. However, before completion the Incident struck and in its half-finished state it was redesigned as a planet to accommodate all the incoming refugees. With a barely breathable atmosphere, poorly developed cities, and a population that well exceeds the limits that it could support at maximum, Majesteka II is covered in permanent gloom. Those who can afford it and are lucky enough to find a way off leave to not be condemned to a life of scarcity and depression. Although technically part of the Empire, through legal loopholes it is considered to be under temporary independent control, allowing the living standards to fall well below the worst in the Empire.</description>
  <bar>Just like the atmosphere throughout the planet, the spaceport bar is a very glum place. The installations look improvised, but the layers of dust indicate that man cycles have passed without any serious reforms. Many vagabonds spend their time here trying to find a ship to get them out of the dump. Not the best place to spend your time.</bar>
