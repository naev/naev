  <description>Stations like this one are a marvel of technology. They span only a few dozen kilometres in diameter, yet have the food production capability to feed several planets. Food is grown so rapidly that it takes a constant stream of merchant ships to take it all away.</description>
  <bar>It is said among spacers that if you sit down in a spacedock bar, order a drink and read a few articles on the galactic news, a whole generation of vegetables will have grown from seed to crop by the time you get up again. This is not true, of course - unless you take small sips.</bar>
