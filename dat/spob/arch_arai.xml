  <description>Once an independent world, home to pirates and black market traders, Arch Arai has long since fallen under the spell of the Touched. Now it is a fairly law-abiding Sirius world, earning its existence through legal trade and industry like almost every other planet. Given its proximity with the Dvaered border, it still continues to attract new immigrants and converts that have recently entered Sirius space.</description>
  <bar>This bar is a quiet place. Though it is certainly not lacking in patronage, the people who come here don't seem about to make a fuss over anything. The effect is contagious making newcomers follow the example of those who are already there, almost instinctively.</bar>
