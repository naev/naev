  <description>Durea is not a terribly pleasant place to live, as it orbits its star a little too distantly for comfort, which leaves most of the planet covered in snow and ice. Only a small portion of the surface thaws far enough in summer for mining operations, but despite that the riches underneath the crust compel a hardy population to dig. Indeed, if one day resources in the galaxy grow sparse enough, Durea may well find itself in an economically superior position.</description>
  <bar>This bar is the standard-issue model that can be found on unpopular mining colonies throughout the galaxy. It's essentially a regular prefab habitation unit converted into a bar. It has all the amenities and features you might expect in a public facility but it offers none of the comfort that bars on metropolis planets tend to sport. The liquor served here is often pretty strong, this is, in no small part, due to the planet's harsh environment.</bar>
