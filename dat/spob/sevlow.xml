  <description>Sevlow is one of the few truly inhabited Thurian worlds. Sevlow is an uneventful planet, as it serves primarily as an agricultural world producing algae, and as a living place for biological Thurions.</description>
  <bar>This bar is crowded with biological Thurions socializing and drinking non-alcoholic beverages. Just like every other Thurion bar, no alcohol is sold as that is believed to damage the brain.</bar>
