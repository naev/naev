  <description>The planet has a harsh, unbreathable carbon dioxide atmosphere with volatile elements. Despite this, microbacterial life seems to be teeming on the planet's surface and large bodies of water. It is likely that this planet could rather easily be terraformed if anyone had the inclination. However, the poor location is a significant deterrent.</description>
