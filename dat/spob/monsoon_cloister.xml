  <description>Monsoon Station is the lone bastion of Sirian law enforcement in this area of space. Though the region is generally quiet, the soldiers here take their responsibility seriously.</description>
  <bar>The spacedock bar is a utilitarian, no-frills affair that is kept clean and in prime functioning condition. Most of the facilities are automated, as Monsoon Station doesn't have the space to keep on a full serving staff.</bar>
