  <description>Although scanners pick up traces of rare minerals, an impressive layer of unstable regolith and constant micro-meteor impacts, plus a less-than-impressive location, have left the source of the minerals intact. There have been several proposals on the realization of the planet's mining and terraforming potential, but they seem to be more of a pipe dream than anything that can be made into reality.</description>
