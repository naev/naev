  <description>What was originally a fairly mineral rich world known as Poller D-4 quickly devolved into its current state in what became known as the Poller incident. While what happened is still officially under investigation, the common consensus is that a research project focusing on developing microrobots for mineral extraction lost control of a batch of self-replicating nanobots. These nanobots quickly began to reproduce by converting all matter into more nanobots, in the first public case of a grey-goo scenario.
The Za'lek have made the best out of the situation by designating the now called Poller Mass as a waste disposal center. Pilots must take care to not make direct contact or they become part of the grey-goo itself.</description>
