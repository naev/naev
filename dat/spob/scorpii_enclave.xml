  <description>Scorpii Enclave is located in the stable zone of the intertwined Scorpii Omega-1 and 2 gas giants, that keep the station in a prime position to overlook the system. The station was developed as a civilian operation and focused on medical developments, however, after the incident, it became a trauma center for the survivors and ended up specializing in the different physical and neurological conditions from prolonged exposure to nebular radiation. Through Imperial funding, it has also started new research into treatments and shielding to survive the deep Nebula with mixed success. Other than extensive medical installations, the station sports fairly high end amenities for pilots.</description>
  <bar>The bar is fairly standard Imperial design, however, it contains several panels extracted from ships that barely survived the incident as a centerpiece to raise awareness about the dangers that nebular radiation possess. The panels are barely unrecognizable and feel warm to the touch and seem to get the message across.</bar>
