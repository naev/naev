  <description>New Europe was once a prosperous M-class world located on the major trade route between Sirius space and Sol. With abundant crop yields and a stable and agreeable climate, many people considered it to be very close to the old less developed Earth. When the Incident occurred, New Europe was outside the explosive barrier and survived unscathed. However, over time, the Nebula began to encroach on the territory, and in a mere 20 cycles was able to block out a significant amount of light and begin to strip the atmosphere off the planet. Although the planet is not yet completely barren and unlivable, it seems like the process is irreversible, leading to the population trying to evacuate and leave the planet towards better territories. Although there is still a fair number of people left, all people of importance to the Sirius have long since left, leaving only the new Nebula refugees.</description>
  <bar>The New Europe Tavern is fairly abandoned, and the few patrons that are there have long faces. It seems like they would be happier drinking off planet, instead of impotently waiting for the demise of their home world. By the size of the tavern, it is clear that it used to be a bustling centre of activity not too long ago.</bar>
