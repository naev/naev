  <description>Gerhart Central was built by the Za'lek Central Council in response to the Empire building Outbound Enclave. The Za'lek felt miffed that the Empire would step in on what they saw as their space and, instead of meekly backing down or risking military conflict, merely built a larger and better-equipped station.
The fact that it would also be an ideal location for defending the Za'lek from Imperial treachery, or for launching an attack into the Empire itself, is an open secret.</description>
  <bar>There are many Za'lek military officials, scientists, and traders from all over in this large and clean bar. It is much nicer than the one on Outbound Enclave. Quite a pointed snub.</bar>
