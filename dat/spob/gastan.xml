  <description>Gastan is one of House Za'leks research worlds that moonlights as a mining world for valuable materials. Many of the labs here are off-limits to outsiders, but the main city and space-port is a popular hub for internal trade and commerce.</description>
  <bar>There is nothing particularly note-worthy about this bar other than the complex machinery on display through metre-thick translucent plasteel. The bar is built underground in a long-drained mining shaft, and the equipment seems to be of interest to many of the patrons.</bar>
