  <description>Somewhat curiously, Imperial Nutrient Supply Station 3 is actually owned by House Dvaered. Though initially constructed by the Empire, the station was ceded to House Dvaered as part of its official inception. INSS-3 still provides food for the Imperial colonies at Virgo and Van Maanen, though the price of food there has gone up by a fair margin ever since the change in ownership.</description>
  <bar>The bar is not much to speak of. The Dvaered have shown a greater interest in farming than in public relations, so the spaceport bar has been largely neglected. It's a wonder the basic facilities are even functional at all.</bar>
