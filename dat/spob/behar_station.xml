  <description>Once a bustling and productive Imperial shipyard, Behar Station suffered heavy structural damage in the Incident. Life support systems quickly fell and most perished in the following moments. Although originally very impressive and able to turn out three full Peacemakers each cycle, the ruins have been picked clean by countless scavengers following its destruction.</description>
