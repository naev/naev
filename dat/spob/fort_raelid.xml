  <description>Hastily constructed by forced labour in the wake of the Incident, Fort Raelid serves as a control point and listening post for Dvaered forces in the area. However, after its construction, Warlords quickly lost interest in the Nebula which was left to the Empire. Other than routine patrols, nothing often happens in this outpost.</description>
  <bar>The Raelid bar fits the Dvaered stereotype well. It's one of the more prominent areas as soon as you exit the docking area, and, as many Dvaered bars seem to be, it's much larger than it functionally needs to be. Far from the spotless bars of Polaris Prime, it's encrusted with dirt and you can sense the presence of other patrons by their smell alone. Truly, a Dvaered bar.</bar>
