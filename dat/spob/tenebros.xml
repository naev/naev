  <description>A small frozen block of ice. The low temperatures and lack of rocky core have kept Tenebros uninhabited since its discovery. Your sensors pick up some wholly encased ships of fairly recent makes, potentially left behind by people escaping the Incident, however, unless you want to burn excessive amounts of fuel trying to reach the ships, it's likely nobody will ever find out what happened.</description>
