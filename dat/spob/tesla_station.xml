  <description>Tesla Station is the centre of operations for the Xeric experimental weapons testing site. Many high energy physics researchers flock over for the easier chances of funding, and more importantly, the ability to perform high energy physics experiments with little or no ethics committee oversight. The result is that the base feels no real different from any large Za'lek research centre or university.</description>
  <bar>The bar is very lively, filled with physics researchers discussing the results of the latest experiments and research directions. From how crowded the bar is, you get the impression that most of the researchers rather converse here than the cramped research rooms. The walls all being whiteboards helps keep the atmosphere tense, more so than than holopanels. There is a prominent sign behind the counter that says "7 periods since the last accident" with a sticky note underneath that says "thanks fred".</bar>
