  <description>This military station was originally supposed to be built in the neighbouring system of Bonanza, but the Soromid military chose to change the location for reasons of logistics. Hasselt has several inhabited planets, and in-system supply routes are always easier to maintain than routes leading through a jump point.</description>
  <bar>Most of the people in this bar are Soromid soldiers. There are few officers, since they have their own facility elsewhere on the station.</bar>
