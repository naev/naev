  <description>A fairly standard large chunk of regolith, it is only notable for Eclipse Citadel performing both training and weapon exercises on the surface. Although it is not officially off-limits to civilians, it is highly recommended to not overstay your welcome lest your ship turns into the new cadets' training target.</description>
