  <description>Vertigo is the second moon orbiting Nartur IV. While the rock itself is utterly uninteresting, Nartur's first moon is anything but. It is a semi-fluid sphere of valuable mineral that often gets used in hyperdrives. Vertigo is the closest place where a harvesting base can be set up, short of building a whole new starbase.</description>
  <bar>Vertigo's spaceport bar has an excellent view of Nartur IV and IVa. Depending on the phase of the various orbital cycles, it can be quite a fetching sight. Of course, some of the time there's very little to see at all.</bar>
