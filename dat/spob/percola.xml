  <description>Percola is a small world, but it is a rather major producer of food within Soromid space. The planet is rich in carbon and gets a lot of sun, so plant life thrives here. The planet sometimes manages as many as four harvests a cycle. About seventy percent of the land surface is used for agriculture, ten percent is used for livestock and the remaining twenty percent is for the residents and supporting infrastructure.</description>
  <bar>This spaceport bar has a view on one of the nearby mega-meadows that sprawl across Percola. The endless sea of uniform vegetation is impressive to behold, but it's only really a small part of what's out there.</bar>
