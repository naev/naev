  <description>Although consisting mainly of a shipbuilding factory, Nexus Shipyards HQ also sports an extravagant tower where the executives and marketing work, directly accessible from the spaceport. The lobby is impressive, with marble floors and columns, it is hard to believe that this is a station with such waste of space. There is also a large waiting area and what seems to be some complementary tea for people visiting, and it seems like many people decide to come directly to the Nexus Shipyards HQ to make their ship purchases.</description>
  <bar>The Nexus bar is split into two areas: one caters the executive class and people looking for more drinks with hefty price tags, while the other is more simple and dedicated to serving the factory workers. The kitchen seems to be the same for both of them, the main thing that changes is the presentation and expenses. Both areas have a good overlook of the ship factory, where you can see the assembly line constantly producing new ships to try to meet the demand. It seems like business is booming for Nexus Shipyards.</bar>
