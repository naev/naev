  <description>Vennis is a planet with characteristics quite close to the Earth Standard. Its gravity, surface area, day-night cycle and annual cycle closely match that of old Earth. It would be a highly suitable planet to live on, were it not for the highly acidic atmosphere. House Sirius has recently settled a dome colony here, with the intent of eventually terraforming the planet to a high class residential world. It will be many cycles before this ideal is be realized but the inhabitants of Vennis persevere.</description>
  <bar>Though the planet is many cycles away from being suitable for open-air human life, the spaceport authorities have put up various promotional holovids that showcase the terraforming effort and its predicted effects. It's a mandatory watch for any visitor to the spaceport bar who wishes to use the standard facilities.</bar>
