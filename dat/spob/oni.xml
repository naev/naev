  <description>Oni is a harsh place to live, with a thick, toxic atmosphere, violent weather and frequent seismic activity. All of this makes it a favoured dumping ground for criminals and other undesirables of Dvaered society. Soldiers assigned here consider it to be a punishment almost as severe as being a prisoner. It's one of the few planets controlled by the central Dvaered government, as no sensible warlord wants the place.</description>
