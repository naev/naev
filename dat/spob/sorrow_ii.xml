  <description>Almost true to its name, Sorrow II is a sad planet designated a waste disposal facility by the whims of a Sirii Arch-Canter. Although at one point there was a small manned station here that allowed for refuelling, it has long been abandoned. Now the planet is little more than a dump location for toxic waste brought from throughout the House Sirius territories.</description>
