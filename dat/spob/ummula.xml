  <description>Ummula is a wealthy residential planet. Its proximity to the Sirian core and the presence of a prestigious military academy in the system have given it all the economic exposure it could want. On the flip side, taxes on Ummula are among the highest in Sirius space, so the population is mostly comprised of working class citizens.</description>
  <bar>Many spaceport bars play music, but few spaceport bars allow their customers control over it. This one does. A central platform contains a control interface that patrons can use to request specific pieces of music to play in the bar. This being Ummula, customers have to pay a fee to access the controls.</bar>
