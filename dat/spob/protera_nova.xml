  <description>You see a massive crater around the severely damaged ship dominating the landscape, with signs indicating that the shockwave travelled all over the relatively small planet.</description>
  <bar>The ship's old bar has been restored to an acceptable state. You're told, oddly enough, that a bar is never supposed to have seats in Proteron culture, but here, considering that the installation skews at a rather worrying angle, there are at least toeholds to keep you from falling.</bar>
