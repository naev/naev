  <description>Chloe I is covered in a dense layer of vegetation, likely brought here by a human visitor many cycles ago. The atmosphere contains large amounts of oxygen, making it flammable and unstable, with planetary-scale conflagrations a frequent phenomena. However, the vegetation has adapted and competes to quickly regrow from the ashes of their predecessors.</description>
