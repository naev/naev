  <description>One of the few industrial backbones of what once was the Yetmer-O'rez family, Highland has become the primary supplier of weapons and ships to House O'rez. There are many military checkpoints throughout the planet, and many of the factories have strict access controls so as to minimize sabotage and spies, which they had significant problems with at the beginning of the war.</description>
  <bar>The Highland Cafe is not quite up to the pre-war standards, however, the portions are surprisingly generous. Most patrons here pilot transport ships, but on occasion military pilots show up too. The ambiance is quite somber, as if everyone has things to do and places to be that don't allow them to fully relax.</bar>
