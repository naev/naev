  <description>Originally an ancient mining outpost, it was acquired by the Space Traders Society shortly after the creation of House Za'lek, anticipating the future of things to come from the area. Since then, it has been expanded and rebuilt upon, all while remaining fully functional, giving it a labyrinth-like and extremely complex layout, which has led to its current name: "The Knot".

Due to the distance from Sol, it has never been as prosperous in commerce as the other Space Traders Society assets, and has been mainly taken over by more engineering-focused guilds. Making use of House Za'lek developments, the Knot has gotten a reputation for having the latest in cutting edge technology.</description>
  <bar>The Knot bar is located at the core of the station, where the original hangars where. As the space station developed, the hangars lost direct access to space, losing their original purpose, and eventually were transformed into the lively atmosphere you find in front of you. Most of the patrons are engineers, both Za'lek and Society alike, who engage in lively conversations on extremely technical details over which they get easily worked up over.</bar>
