  <description>Theras IV was once considered for colonization, however, the increase of animosity between the Frontier and House Dvaered led to it being declared an unmanned waste disposal site. Although meant for usage by the Frontier, it has seen an increase in usage by House Dvaered, whose ships do not always pay the required processing fees.</description>
