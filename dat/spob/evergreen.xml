  <description>A densely lush tropical word with extremely large quantities of micro-organisms in the air that pretty much require hazard suits to be outside. Most of the locals make use of not complete space suits, but very minimal protection that seems to be not much more than some special cloth with small eye cover lenses. However, they also seem to be very used to living in the constant grime and highly bioactive environment, which probably takes quite a while to adapt to. Due to the precautions required outside, most of the buildings are connected to each other with tubes, making for a claustrophobic space station-like enviroment.

Despite having so much life, the planet is not very productive in human-edible goods and doesn't make much more food than what is needed to sustain its current population. Nontheless, the dense atmosphere and the lack of significant military targets on the surface attracts many O'rez citizens who try to make life on Evergreen in an attempt to ignore the war raging on around them.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport bar is very compact, embedded directly under the spaceport like on many space stations. The first thing that strikes your attention is the extremely high humidity, likely necessary to accomodate the bio-active brews on sale in the bar. It seems like they have perfected cultivating the local micro-organisms to make all sorts of foods and drinks. You try a few, and are not entirely sure what to make of them.</bar>
