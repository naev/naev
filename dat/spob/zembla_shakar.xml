  <description>Zembla Shakar is like a resort for the elite within the Shakar system. The people who live here live on gigantic estates that they usually haven't seen all of. Most of the planet is off-limits to offworlders, and most traffic to the planet consists of imports of luxury goods and exports of waste products.</description>
  <bar>The bar is where traders wait until their cargo is loaded and unloaded. Pilots who come here expecting a glimpse of the rich lands that cover the surface of the planet will be disappointed, as there is very little to see here.</bar>
