  <description>Tankard Station is a Sirius economical space facility. It processes a large portion of all trade transactions made within An'ku, and also serves as a terminal for the materials produced by Sroolu. There is also a small security detail stationed here, but this is merely for the purpose of customs, not so much the repulsion of hostile elements.</description>
  <bar>Serving both as a trading hub and an outlet of consumer end products, the spacedock bar on Tankard Station is always a bustle of activity. In fact, the actual bar seems more like a section of a larger commerce centre than the other way around.</bar>
