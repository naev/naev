  <description>As Aesir is so far away and many government services  are better rendered locally than over a distance of many hyperspace jumps, Burnan serves as the local capital in this sector of Sirius space. Because of this, the primary city of Burnan sports an atypically large political district in its primary city, as well as one of the largest Sirian temples in all of Sirius space.
Due to the highly political nature of the planet, the cities and districts are designed with specific echelons in mind, and mixing is kept to a minimum.</description>
  <bar>Burnan doesn't have a separate spaceport bar in the way many other worlds do. The spaceport bar and the main spaceport hall are, instead, one and the same thing. There are exits to terminals on all sides and the central area is dominated by an island of service interfaces and counters. There is an elevated area that has tables for visitors to sit down at, where they won't get in the way of the bustle and traffic of the main floor.</bar>
