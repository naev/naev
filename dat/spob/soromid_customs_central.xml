  <description>The Soromid and the rest of the galaxy have enjoyed a tense kind of friendship ever since the first bioships launched from Sorom. The rest of humanity is keenly interested in Soromid genetic treatments and the Soromid, in turn, are happy to turn a profit on their expertise, but there's still some degree of caution on both sides.
Soromid Customs Central is a visible sign of that caution. In addition to inspecting the traffic that passes through Oberon, it also houses a full division of Soromid ships responsible for maintaining the order in this space.</description>
