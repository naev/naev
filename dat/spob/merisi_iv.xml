  <description>The planet is covered in a thick layer of what was once organic gunk, but has degraded beyond recognition. It is speculated life here had reached the primordial soup stage of evolution, but for reasons unclear, some millions of years ago, the planetary core cooled, leading to an unrecoverable mass extinction event. It is now a testament to the fragility of life in the harsh universe.</description>
