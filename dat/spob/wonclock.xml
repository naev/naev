  <description>The Soromid have more or less stabilized as a genetically modified offshoot from humanity, but that doesn't mean research into genetic alteration isn't still ongoing. Wonclok hosts one of the largest bioresearch centres in Soromid space. Many of the commercially sold gene treatments were developed here, and being a researcher on Wonclok carries a lot of prestige with the Soromid.</description>
  <bar>Being such an important location for Soromid society, security on Wonclok is pretty tight. In particular, visitors have their background checked, to make sure they're not here with a Za'lek agenda. The spaceport bar can only be accessed after pilots have passed all the security protocols.</bar>
