  <description>Originally a state-of-the-art agricultural research center, Tau Ceti Station did not survive the Incident; the blast immediately punctured the station's hull and destroyed its life support systems.
Tau Ceti Station quickly devolved into chaos, with multitudes of ships attempting to evacuate its population. The station's docks, not meant to deal with such heavy ship traffic, became jammed; ships began ramming into each other in their attempts to flee. The result is a horrible, tumultuous mass of ships mashed together with the station hull, looking almost like a macabre statue to death. The fact that many parts have been cut open and salvaged by scavengers makes it all the more of a twisted tragedy.</description>
