--[[
-- Maikki (Maisie McPherson) asks you to find her father, the famous pilot Kex
-- McPherson. She heard rumours he was still alive and at Minerva station.
-- Player found out that Za'lek doing stuff with the ship cargo.
--
-- 1. Told to try to find who could have been involved and given three places to look at.
-- Hint 1: Jorla in Regas (University)
-- Hint 2: Cantina Center in Qulam (Trade Hub)
-- Hint 3: Jurai in Hideyoshi's Star (University)
-- 2. After talking to all three, the player is told to go to Naga in Damien (Underwater University)
-- 3. Mentions eccentric colleague at Westhaven
-- 4. Eccentric colleague makes the player mine some stupid stuff for him.
-- 5. Tells you he saved him and sent him off to "Minerva Station".
-- 6. Go back and report to Maikki confirming her info.
--
-- Eccentric Scientist in "Westhaven" (slightly senile with dementia).
