   Destroy Za'lek hacking station

   TODO probably should be changed from Gammacron to Fried system

   This mission has two ways of being done:
   1. Using brute force and killing everything.
   2. Using stealth if the player boards the drone controllers or hacking center, they can disable drones.

   There are drones patrolling the hacking center, it requires disabling two drone controllers to get there.
   There are also drones wandering around that are independent / depend on the hacking center.
