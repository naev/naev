    "Ah, if it isn't %s!" he says. "I think you might be perfect for this job. See, my team and I are going to be conducting an important covert operation in Raelid. I won't bore you with the details of that operation, but I need someone to distract the Dvaered forces while we do this. You'll basically need to travel to the %s system and wreak havoc there so that the Dvaereds go after you."
    His expression suddenly becomes serious. "This will be a highly dangerous mission, and I can't guarantee any backup for you. However, you will be paid substantially, and I can guarantee you that doing this mission will earn you a great amount of respect. Would you be interested?"]]

   text[2] = [["Great! I and my team will be hiding out around Raelid until we get a chance to conduct the operation. I will message you when we succeed. Good luck, and try not to get yourself killed!" With that, he smiles and walks off, presumably to prepare his team for takeoff.]]

What we've accomplished will greatly help our efforts against the Dvaereds in the future." He hands you a credit chip. "That's your payment. I hope to work with you again, soldier!"
