    "See, for some reason, a group of FLF pilots has decided to turn traitor on us. They're hanging around outside of Sindbad and shooting us down. They need to be stopped, but no one wants to get their hands dirty killing fellow FLF pilots. But they're not FLF pilots anymore! They betrayed us! Can't anyone see that?" She takes a deep breath.

They're no better than Dvaereds, or those Empire scum who started shooting at us recently! Thank you for accepting the mission. Now I should at least be able to get a couple more pilots to join in and help you defend our interests against the traitors. Good luck!"]])
