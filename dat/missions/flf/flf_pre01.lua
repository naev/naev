   This is the first "prelude" mission leading to the FLF campaign. The player takes a FLF agent onboard, then either turns him in to the Dvaered or delivers him to a hidden FLF base.
   stack variable flfbase_intro:
       1 - The player has turned in the FLF agent or rescued the Dvaered crew. Conditional for dv_antiflf02
       2 - The player has rescued the FLF agent. Conditional for flf_pre02
       3 - The player has found the FLF base for the Dvaered, or has betrayed the FLF after rescuing the agent. Conditional for dv_antiflf03
