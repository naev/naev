He sits up straight and looks you dead in the eye. "However, there is one condition." You pause for a moment, then ask what that condition is.
    "Pretty simple, at least in the abstract," he answers. "Here's the deal: we will do what we can to peacefully put an end to Dvaered influence on the Frontier systems. We will also work to establish the FLF as a legitimate police organization to keep the Frontier safe from future threats of invasion.
    "However, there's going to need to be some serious effort on the part of the FLF. You are going to need to prove that you are after what you say you're after. That means putting an end to all terrorist activities and re-establishing yourselves as a purely defensive militia."]])

Thank you for your service." She hands you a credit chip and walks off.]])
