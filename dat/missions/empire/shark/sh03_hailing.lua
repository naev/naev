I have noticed a member of the Frontier Council who, for political reasons could help us.
	I can't send him a message without being spotted by the Sirii, so I need you to make contact with him : he should be flying in his Hawking in %s now. Go there, hail him, and just tell him that I have to see him on Curie in Kohler. He will understand. Oh, by the way, my new name is Donald Ulnish.
	And there is something else: I heared that the Sirii hired some henchmen to go after you, you have perhaps already met them. The good point is that they don't know that Nexus is involved, but still, be careful.
	Are you in?"]]
