Some sort of weird wireless module. We'd like you to do a deep scan of the nearby Collective systems to see if you can pick up any strange wireless communications. This will be a dangerous mission, because you'll need to stay in the system long enough for the scan to complete. I recommend a fast ship to outrun the drones.
