Some sort of weird wireless module. We'd like you to do a deep scan of the nearby Collective systems to see if you can pick up any strange wireless communications. This will be a dangerous mission, because you'll need to stay in the system long enough for the scan to complete. I recommend a fast ship to outrun the drones. Are you interested in doing this now?"]]

   "Of course, we're not sending you in blind. I have updated your ship's computer with a map of the Collective systems, at least the part we know about. I'm afraid it's not very complete intel, but it should be enough.
