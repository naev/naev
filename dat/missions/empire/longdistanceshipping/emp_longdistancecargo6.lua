Can I count on you?"]])

text[3] = _([[Lieutent Czesc exits your ship and takes a deep breath of air. "I love the smell of bureaucracy in the morning." He shakes your hand. "Thanks for all your help, Captain! Follow me to headquarters and we can do some paperwork to get you all set up. After that you should start to receive long-distance shipping missions. They pay better than our regular shipping missions, but often require travelling longer distances and into territory controlled by other factions. You'll probably be more likely to see them on the edges of Empire space where cargo is ready to head out to other factions. Again, I can't thank you enough! The Empire does not quickly forget such dedication."]])
