The frontier can be a bit dangerous, so make sure you're prepared. You need to drop the bureaucrat off at The Frontier Council in Gilligan's Light system. After this, there should only be one more faction to bring into the fold. I expect to see you again soon."]])

This last bureaucrat refused to stay in her quarters, preferring to hang out on the bridge and give you the ins and outs of Empire bureaucracy. Only your loyalty to the Empire stopped you from sending her out into the vacuum of space.]])
