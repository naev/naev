You've done a great job with those Empire Shipping missions and we have a new exicting opportunity. You see, the head office is looking to expand business with other factions, which has enormous untapped business potential. They need someone competent and trustworthy to help them out. That's where you come in. Interested?"]])

In addition, you'll often find yourself in the territory of other factions, where the Empire may not be able to protect you. In return, you will be nicely compensated. He hits a couple buttons on his wrist computer. "First, we need to set up operations with the other factions. We'll need a bureaucrat to handle the red tape and oversee the operations. We will begin with the Soromid. I know those genetically modified beings are kind of creepy, but business is business. Please accompany a bureaucrat to Soromid Customs Central in the Oberon system. He will report back to me when this mission is accomplished. I tend to travel within Empire space handling minor trade disputes, so keep an eye out for me in the bar on Empire controlled planets."]])
