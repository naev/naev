   Introduction to Point of Interest (Sensor Anomaly) missions.

   We assume it is started from a derelict event.

   1. Follow NPC to sensor anomaly.
   2. NPC activates scanning outfit and is attacked by a bandit hyena.
   3. Destroy hyena and follow trails.
   4. Loot goal and get Pulse Scanner!
