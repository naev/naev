   MISSION: The complaining grandma
   DESCRIPTION: The player is taking an old woman from Dvaered space to Sirius space.
   The old woman keeps muttering about how the times have changed and how it used to be when she was young.

    "As a matter of fact, there is," she creaks. "I want to visit my cousin, she lives on %s, you know, in the %s system, it's a Sirian place. But I don't have a ship and those blasted passenger lines around here don't fly on Sirius space! I tell you, customer service really has gone down the gutter over the years. In my space faring days, there would always be some transport ready to take you anywhere! But now look at me, I'm forced to get to the spaceport bar to see if there's a captain willing to take me! It's a disgrace, that's what it is. What a galaxy we live in! But I ramble. You seem like you've got time on your hands. Fancy making a trip down to %s? I'll pay you a decent fare, of course."]]
    text2 = [["Oh, that's good of you." The old woman gives you a wrinkly smile. "I haven't seen my cousin in such a long time, it'll be great to see how she's doing, and we can talk about old times. Ah, old times. It was all so different then. The space ways were much safer, for one. And people were politer to each other too, oh yes!"
    You escort the old lady to your ship, trying not to listen to her rambling. Perhaps it would be a good idea to get her to her destination as quickly as you can.]]

She keeps grumbling about how spaceports these days are so inconvenient and how advertisement holograms are getting quite cheeky of late, they wouldn't allow that sort of thing in her day. But once you deliver her to the exit terminal, she smiles at you.
    "Thank you, young captain, I don't know what I would have done without you. It seems there are still decent folk out there even now. Take this, as a token of my appreciation."
    The lady hands you a credit chip. Then she disappears through the terminal. Well, that was quite a passenger!]]
