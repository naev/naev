   MISSION: Defend the System 1
   DESCRIPTION:
      A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
      This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
      After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
      The player will have the option to join the militia.
      Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.

      Notable events:
       - Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defence force.
       - Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
       - Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
       - Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
       - Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.

TODO
Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
