   MISSION: Defend the System 3
   DESCRIPTION:
      A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
      This will be the third in a series of random encounters.
      After the mission, perhaps there'll be a regular diet of similar missions
      Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.

      Notable events:
       - Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defence force.
       - Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
       - Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
       - Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
       - Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.

NOTE
Because of bad planning, this mission is badly organized.
Anyone looking for a model of good mission-making should look elsewhere! -- the author
