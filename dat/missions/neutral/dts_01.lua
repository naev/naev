   MISSION: Defend the System 2
   DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
                This will be the second in a planned series of random encounters.
                After the third mission, perhaps there'll be a regular diet of similar missions
                Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.

      Notable events:

         * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
         * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
         * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
         * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
         * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.

TO DO
Make comm chatter appear during the battle
Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
