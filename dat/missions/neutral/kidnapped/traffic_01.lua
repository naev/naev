   The Ruse

   A girl asks you to find his brother but it turns out it is her assassination target.
   Creates a ship in one out of 3 listed systems. The system and planet the brother is is chosen randomly.
   spawns some mercenaries that were supposed to protect the brother to intercept the player.
   Why is it in the Kidnapped campaign? Because this one never got finished and we can later claim the guy that got killed was involved in the human trafficking
