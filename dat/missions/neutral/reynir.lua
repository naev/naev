   MISSION: Hot dogs from space
   DESCRIPTION: An old man who owns a hot dog factory wants to go to space

   The old man has elevated pressure in his cochlea so he can't go to space.
   He's getting old and wants to go to space before he dies. He owns a hot dog
   factory and will pay you in hot dogs (food). Because of his illness, you
   can't land on any planet outside the system (the player doesn't know this).

   NOTE: This mission is best suited in systems with 2 or more planets, but can
   be used in any system with a planet.
