text[1] = [[As you approach the group, the babbling ceases and the papers are quickly and jealously stashed away. One of the girls comes forward and introduces herself.
    "Hi, I'm Mia. We need transportation, and you look as if you could need some dough. Interested?"
    You reply that for a deal to be worked out, they better provide some detail.
    "Listen," she says, "there's this Homebrew Processing Box Masters on %s. Right over there, this system. I'm sure our box will get us the first prize. You take us there, you take us back, you get 20000."
    You just start wondering at the boldness of so young a lady as she already signals her impatience. "What now, you do it?"]]

-- you accept
title[2] = _("We have a deal!")
text[2] = [[Upon accepting the task, you see the entire group relax visibly, and you can almost feel Mia's boldness fade away - to some extent, at least. It seems that the group is quite keen on the competition, but until now had no idea how to get there.
    As the others scramble to get up from their cramped table and start to gather their belongings, it is again up to Mia to address you:
    "Really? You'll do it? Um, great. Fantastic. I just knew that eventually, someone desperate would turn up. Ok, we're set to go. We better take off immediately and go directly to %s, or we'll be late for the contest!"]]
  
-- right planet, in time
title[3] = _("Happy nerds")
text[3] = [["Good job, %s," Mia compliments you upon arrival. "We'll now go win the competition and celebrate a bit. You better stay in the system. We will hail you in about 4 or 5 STP, so you can pick us up an' bring us back to %s."
    That said, the nerds shoulder the box and rushes towards a banner which reads "Admissions".]]

-- right planet, late
title[4] = _("Angry nerds")
text[4] = [[Mia fumes. "Great. Just great! We're late, you jerk." She points to a crumpled banner reading "Admissions". The area below it is deserted. "No contest for us, no payment for you. Understand? Go and take your sorry excuse for a ship into the corona of a suitable star. We will find someone else to take us back to %s. Someone reliable."
    As her emphasis on the last words is still ringing in your ears, the gang of nerds stroll toward an archway, behind which, judging from the bustling atmosphere, the contest is already going on.]]

-- wrong planet, late
title[5] = _("Furious nerds")
text[5] = [[The nerds quickly and quietly pack up their box and start to leave your ship. Finally, Mia turns to you. Her body language suggests that she's almost bursting with anger. Yet her voice is controlled when she starts talking:
    "You're a sorry loser. The contest is almost over and we are stranded in some dump we never wanted to see. I'm sure you agree that this isn't worth any payment." She turns to leave, but then adds: "Are you sure that everything is in order with your ship's core? You don't want it to melt down just in the middle of a fight, do you?" With this, she joins the rest of her group, and they are gone.]]

-- you are hailed to pick them up again
title[6] = _("In-system communication")
text[6] = [[A beep from your communications equipment tells you that someone wants to talk to you. You realize it is the nerds, and return the hail. "Yo! This is Mia," comes a familiar voice from the speaker. "We're done here. Time to come back and pick us up, we have things to do on %s."]]

title[7] = _("In-system communication")
text[7] = [[Your comm link comes up again. It is the nerds, whom you'd almost forgotten. You hear Mia's voice: "Hey, what are you waiting for? Better be here within one STP, or we'll get another pilot and pay them, not you!"]]

-- you pick up the nerds in time, they won
title[8] = _("Happy nerds")
text[8] = [[As soon as you get of your ship, you are surrounded by the group of nerds, who are enthusiastic. "We won!" one of the dudes shouts at you. Surprisingly, the group seems to not completely be dependent on Mia when it comes to communicating with outsiders. Maybe the booze the group is obviously intoxicated with did help a little. "Take us back to %s," one of them says, "we'll continue to celebrate on the way."]]

-- you pick up the nerds in time, they didn't win
title[9] = _("Sad nerds")
text[9] = [[As you get of your ship, you do not immediately see the nerds. You finally find them in a dark corner of the landing pad quietly sitting on their box, obviously not in a good mood. You greet them, but nobody speaks a word. "Hey, what's up? Come on, tell me!" you inquire. The nerds warily glance at each other, and finally Mia bursts out:
    "That aristocratic ass of a bored teenager! He snatched the prize from us! It wasn't even fair play. His box wasn't home built. It was a brand new ship's processing unit, on which he banged his hammer until it looked acceptable. And the corrupt idiots in the jury pretended not to notice!"
    "So no, we didn't win" she adds after taking a few breaths to calm down. "Take us back to %s.]]

-- you do not pickup the nerds in time
title[10] = _("No more nerds")
text[10] = [[You look around, but the nerds are nowhere to be found. That is not much of a surprise, seeing that you are way too late.
    Suddenly, a guy approaches you. "Hi, are you %s? The nerds wanted you to know that, basically, they got another transport home. One of the girls said some more, in a particularly rude language, but I don't remember the details".]]

-- you do not pickup the nerds in time, and don't even land on the right planet
title[11] = _("You forgot the nerds")
text[11] = [[Seeing that it is already too late to pick up the nerds, and that you're quite far from %s, you decide it's better to forget about them completely.]]

-- you return the nerds, who have won the contest
title[12] = _("The End")
text[12] = [[The nerds, finally exhausted from all the partying, still smile as they pack up their prize-winning box and leave your ship. Mia beams as she turns to you. "Well done, %s. You see, since we got loads of prize money, we decided to give you a bonus. After all, we wouldn't have gotten there without your service. Here, you have 30000. Good day to you."]]

-- you return the nerds, who did not win the contest
title[13] = _("Minor Complications")
text[13] = [[With sagging shoulders, the nerds unload their box. Mia turns to address you, not bold at all this time. "Um, we got a bit of a problem here. You know, we intended to pay the trip from our prize money. Now we don't have no prize money."
    As you're trying to decide what to make of the situation, one of the other nerds creeps up behind Mia and cautiously gestures for her to join the group a few yards away, all the time avoiding your eyes. Strange guy, you think, as if he was not accustomed to be socializing with strangers. Mia joins the group, and some whispering ensues. Mia returns to you after a few minutes.
    "Ok, we have just solved our problem. See, that ass of a champion won the contest with a ship's processing unit. We can do it the other way round. We'll modify our box so that it can be used as a ship's coprocessor, and you can have it as a compensation for your troubles. Interested?"]]

title[14] = _("So what?")
text[14] = [["Honestly, there is nothing you can do about it," Mia says impatiently, as if you were a small child complaining about the finiteness of an ice cream cone. "Just stand by while we rig the thing up."]]

title[15] = _("The End")
text[15] = [["You can wait for it, won't take longer than half a STP," Mia informs you. You stand by as the nerds start to mod their box. As they are going for it, you wonder if they're actually wrecking it and you'll maybe be left with a piece of worthless junk.
    Finally, the modified box is set before you. "Here you are. Now you're the proud owner of the system's only home-made coprocessing unit. It's gotten a bit bulkier than we thought, with all this rigging for energy and coolant supply, but it should work just fine. We must go now and think about something more advanced for the next competition. Have a nice day."
    With that, the nerds leave. Having gotten nothing else out of this, you think you should visit an outfitter to see if the box may actually be of any use.]]

Consider our agreement nullified. I hope to never again have business with you." Some angry stares later, the nerds are gone, trying to find another pilot.]]
