   This is the second half of "The Runaway"
   Here, Cynthia's father pays you to track down his daughter.
   It is alluded to that Cynthia ran away due to her abusive mother.
   The father has been named after me, Old T. Man.
   I'm joking about the last line a little. If you want to name him, feel free.
