   Drinking Aristocrat
   Author: geekt
   Idea from todo list.

   An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.
