  Anyway Im a little short on credits but heres %s for the troubles. I know it's not a lot, so I will also give you a 5 percent share in my new venture".
  He says. You accept the credits and begin to wonder what these shares could be worth. probably nothing but oh well. As Michal walks off he turns around and yells
  "Meet me in the bar in a few days if you want to talk more business!"]])

  You hand off the recipes and watch as workers begin to unload the cake, wondering how anybody could eat such vile cake, and why they are unloading your cake.
  "This stuff sells like crazy if you know where to sell it, I'll take care of it for you though. It sells for about 1000 a ton, I'll credit it to your account."
  As Michal walks off leaving you wondering why anyone would pay for such bad cake. Michal turns around and yells "Oh yea, You are also a 5 percent shareholder in
  my new venture now. Meet me in the bar in a few days if you want to talk more business!". As you check your account you notice you are %s credits richer.]])
