   I want you to bring this to my associates in the %s system. While the local authorities have proven corruptible, my associates will ensure that this man ends up in prison, where he belongs. I must warn you, however:
   He is a man of considerable influence. He has many friends, and no doubt will send some of his mercenaries to stop you. You'll need a fast ship to shake them off. My associates will compensate you generously when you reach %s.
   Regrettably, you are not the first pilot I've contacted regarding this matter. Your predecessor was intercepted when he landed en route to %s. The crime lord has many underlings lurking in nearby spaceports -- you must NOT land until you've delivered the data."
