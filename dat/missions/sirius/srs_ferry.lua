--[[
-- This mission involves ferrying Sirian pilgrims to Mutris ... with complications
-- Higher-class citizens will pay more, but be more picky about their accomodations
--   (they will want to arrive in style in a Sirian ship)
-- Lower-class citizens will be more flexible, even willing to be dropped off nearby
--   if the player doesn't have clearance to land on Mutris
--
-- Est. reward, from Eiderdown (4 jumps):
--  Shaira:  50K - 100K (18 in 21)
--  Fyrra:  150K - 275K  (2 in 21)  (discounted for alternate dest or ship)
--  Serra:  450K - 800K  (1 in 21)  (discounted for alternate dest or ship)
--
-- Est. reward from Rhu (12 jumps):
--  Shaira: 150K - 300K
--  Fyrra:  400K - 775K
--  Serra:  1.1M - 2.2M
--
-- Standing bonus:  (numjumps-4)/2, + up to (1+rank) randomly
--   0-3 at Eiderdown,  2-5 at distance 8,  4-7 at Rhu
--
-- All missions can be made in a Fidelity with an afterburner
