title1 = _("Talking to Joanne")
text1 = _([["Hello there %s," Joanne greets you. "We do seem to keep running into each other, don't we? Like they say, it's a small galaxy after all."
    You and Joanne spend some time chatting. You learn that Joanne often comes to public spaceport bars to relax. She doesn't seem to enjoy the military cantinas much for some reason. After some small talk, the conversation inevitably gets on the topic of your previous encounter.
    "Actually, that's still bothering me," Joanne confides. "Like I told you, the whole incident with Harja at the academy was a closed chapter for me until the attempts at my life started. It's been giving me sleepless nights. I don't mind admitting that I'm a little scared that someone out there is trying to kill me, but that's not everything. I know Harja, or at least I knew him for years. These assassinations, the whole fraud, it doesn't add up with the image I had of him. I've been thinking what to do about it, but I'm not sure. I considered reporting the matter to my superiors and let the armed forces handle it, and that would probably be the end of it, but I can't shake the feeling that I would never be free from these doubts I'm having.
    "Actually, %s, now that you're here anyway, maybe you can help me figure out what's really happening. I need to know, it's really preying on my mind. Since you've been so helpful in the past, maybe you're willing to make another effort?"]])

text1r = _([["Hi %s," Joanne says. "Good to see you again. Say, I still haven't resolved that issue with Harja and the attempts on my life. Any chance you've changed your mind about helping out a damsel in distress? Let me tell you again what I want you to do."]])

text2 = _([["I want you to get out there and find Harja. I doubt he's on the Wringer anymore, that place isn't healthy to stick around for anyone, especially an academic type like Harja. He's probably on the move, doing whatever it is he does to be able to hire those assassins. So, I need you to intercept him and get him to tell you what he thinks he's doing. I don't know where he is now, you'll have to look for him yourself. I don't think he'll venture outside Sirius controlled space though. He won't be happy to see you, of course, so you may have to be a little... persuasive, shall we say? Just make sure to find out what his motives are and what it'll take for him to leave the past alone. But!" and here Joanne's face turns stern, "I don't want any serious harm to come to him. You may be thinking that removing Harja will solve the problem, but even if he's a threat to my life, murder is still murder. This is a private investigation, not a private war. Are we clear?"
    You acknowledge that you won't kill Harja if you can possibly help it. This seems to satisfy Joanne.
    "Good. I know I can trust you, %s. I can offer you 150,000 credits if you complete this job. Go find Harja. Make him talk. Then come back and tell me what he said. Maybe, hopefully, it'll put my mind at rest."]])

title2 = _("The hunt begins")
text3 = _([["Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Here, I'll upload the details of Harja's private ship into your computer. I did some digging in the military database to find them. You don't graduate from the Sinass High Academy with honors without picking up a few tricks! I know, I know, it's classified data, but it's for a good cause, wouldn't you say? You should be able to identify Harja when you pick him up on your sensors now. If you have trouble locating him, consider installing better sensors on your ship so you can pick him up from farther away. But don't spend too much effort looking for him, just keep a look out as you go about your normal business. If you just stay in Sirius space, I'm sure you'll run into him sooner or later."
    Joanne gets up to leave, but before she goes she adds, "I'll be on %s for a while longer, so come back here when you've got something. Good luck!"]])

title3 = _("Harja's ire")
text4 = _([[You hail Harja's ship. A few moments later his face appears on your console. When he recognizes you, his face sets in an angry scowl.
    "You! How dare you show your face to me again after doublecrossing me like that! I had a perfect shot at taking out that damn woman, but you had to go and tip her off instead. Worse, you even helped her fight off the other guys I hired to blast her into space dust! You ruined everything! The past cycles of my life, completely wasted! Damn you!"
    You try to convince Harja that you want to have a word with him about this matter, but he is furious. "I've got nothing to say to a traitorous scumbag like you! Now leave me alone, I'm having a bad day as it is without you spoiling it further!" With that, Harja breaks the connection. Oh well, looks like you're going to have to do this the hard way.]])

title4 = _("A friendly chat at gunpoint")
text5 = _([[You step through the airlock onto Harja's ship. Harja comes storming out of the cockpit, his face red with rage, but he pipes down considerably when you draw your sidearm and point it at his chest. It takes little further persuasion to get him to take his captain's seat again and hear you out.
    "What do you mean, my side of the story?" Harja grumbles after you've explained your actions. "I'm taking revenge, that's all there is to it. Did she tell you about the academy on Sinass? Okay. Did she also tell you how she framed me for the computer hack? No, I bet she didn't! But that's the truth of it, mark my words! She knew I was at least as good as she was, so she needed to get rid of me to be sure she'd get the promotion. Oh yeah, she's a clever one, is Joanne. She knew nobody would believe she'd try to forge her own scores, and everyone knew I was her only competition. So she set me up! Just to get me expelled! I spent almost my whole life up to that point getting to where I was, and she destroyed it in a single night. Yeah, I want revenge. It's all I've got left."]])

text6 = _([[You point out that Harja had more than enough motive to place that hack himself, and that, unlike Harja's, you have no reason to doubt Joanne's integrity. Harja deflates a little.
    "Okay, look, I know what it looks like. I know I was hanging out on the Wringer, that I hired you as a hitman and that I lied about her being a criminal. That doesn't help my case. But I didn't do it! I was confident I could win the promotion fair and square. Still think I would have gotten it if I hadn't been thrown out. I can't prove it, but on Sirichana I swear it wasn't me. And now you either believe me or you believe her. I've told you everything."
    It's clear to you that you're not going to get anything else out of him. You don't know what to make of this. Both Harja and Joanne seem convinced that the other hacked the academy's computer, and neither of them has any evidence to prove their claim. This whole matter doesn't seem any closer to a conclusion than before, but you have little choice other than to report your findings to Joanne at this point.]])

title5 = _("Full circle")
text7 = _([[You meet Joanne in the spaceport bar. She listens to your account of your conversation with Harja. When you're finished, she frowns.
    "I've got to admit, I find his story a little disturbing. He genuinely seems to believe I framed him for that hack, just as I believe he tried to frame me. From what you told me, it doesn't seem like he was just putting up a self-righteous story to justify his actions, and I wouldn't expect that from him anyway. But that's impossible. Besides the two of us, there was nobody who had the slightest interest in removing eiter one of us from the academy. I know I didn't do it, so that means Harja must have done it. Only..." Joanne pauses. "You said he swore an oath. Whatever else I might think of him, I can't quite believe he would abuse his Sirian beliefs in such a way. We Sirii take our faith very seriously.
    "I don't know what to say, %s. The more I find out about all this, the less sense it makes. I need to think about this, see if there's something I can figure out on my side. I suspect this isn't the end of it yet, though, so I may need your help again soon. But for now, I should give you what I promised you so you can take care of your other matters."
    Joanne pays you the agreed upon sum. Then she walks out of the spaceport bar, a thoughtful expression on her face. It seems your role in the conflict between Joanne and Harja is growing. Who knows where it'll end.]])
