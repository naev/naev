We didn't know what to do at first, but then Jan Jusi pi Lawa came to lead us. He was the one who named us, the Nasin, which means "The Way" in an old earth language."
   Shaman seems to get caught up in the moment. "It was he! He who led us to join our hands! He who led us to work together! He who led us to fight back against the oppressors! It was he! The very, the only, the True Voice of Sirichana!"
