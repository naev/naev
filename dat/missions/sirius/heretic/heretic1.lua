As all religions do at some point, however, the teachings of Sirichana became weighed down by the ideologies and agendas of man. Most people still accepted these teachings as straight from the mouth of Sirichana himself, but we, the Nasin, knew better.
    "We started a splinter religion, still trying to cooperate with the Sirii, but when they felt threatened by our presence, they branded us as heretics and forced us out of Sirius space. We didn't know what to do at first, but then Jan Jusi pi Lawa came to lead us. He was the one who named us, the Nasin, which means "The Way" in an old earth language."
    Shaman seems to get caught up in the moment. "It was he! He who led us to join our hands! He who led us to work together! He who led us to fight back against the oppressors! It was he! The very, the only, the True Voice of Sirichana!"
