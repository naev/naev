--[[misn title - the egress]]
--[[this mission begins with the frenetic nasin wanting to escape
	the wringer due to being overwhelmed by house sirius. the player
	loads up with as many nasin as their vessel will carry, and takes
	them to seek refuge in the ingot system on planet ulios, where they
	begin to rebuild and plan.... (ominous music).
	this mission is designed to be the end of part 1, and is supposed
	to be very hard, and slightly combat oriented, but more supposed to
	involve smuggling elements.]]

As you get in the cabin and begin rising into the air you see Draga running back into the bay to help a woman run with her children to a small inter-planetary skiff. Some Sirius soldiers run and catch up with him, giving him three shots in the chest. The last thing you see as you take off was Draga in a pool of blood, and the woman being dragged off by the soldiers. You rocket out of there, and begin prepping to get those people to safety.]]
