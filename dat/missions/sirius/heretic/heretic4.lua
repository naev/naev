--[[this mission begins with the frenetic Nasin wanting to escape
   The Wringer due to being overwhelmed by House Sirius. The player
   loads up with as many Nasin as their vessel will carry, and takes
   them to seek refuge in the ingot system on planet Ulios, where they
   begin to rebuild and plan.... (ominous music).
   this mission is designed to be the end of part 1, and is supposed
   to be very hard, and slightly combat oriented, but more supposed to
   involve smuggling elements.]]
