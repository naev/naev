If the glass is dirty, then the light is distorted, and doesn't come through correctly. If the glass is mishappen or broken, the light may not filter through at all. We, the Nasin, are the purest glass there is, and House Sirius has become corrupt. We exist to see its downfall."]]

We want you to handle that, as you see fit. Keep them away from the station. Better yet, kill them. We can pay you %s. We do ask that you stay in-system and off-planet until the mission is complete, otherwise you'll be considered AWOL, which means you're fired."]]
