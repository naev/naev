-- The player pays a fellow pirate to know where to steal a random ship.

   The player pays to get the position of a ship on a random planet of a random
   faction. When he gets there, the planet is guarded (which means he may have
   to fight his way through, which is the most probable option).

   When he lands on the target planet, he gets a nice message explaining what
   happens, he gets a new ship, is able to refit it, etc.

   Then, when the player wants to leave the planet, and that will eventually
   happen (at least, I hope…) he’ll be pursued by a few fighters.
