We have to act now: I have noticed a member of the Frontier Council who, for political reasons, could help us.
   I can't send him a message without being spotted by the Sirii, so I need you to take contact with him: he must be flying in his Hawking in %s now. Go there, hail him, say him that I have to see him on %s in %s and he will understand. Oh, by the way, my new name is Donald Ulnish.
   And there is something else: I heard that the Sirii hired some henchmen to go after you, you maybe already have met them. The good news is that they don't know that Nexus is involved, but still, be careful.
   Are you in?"]]
