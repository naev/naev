   The problem is that this person is very difficult to spot." You ask him if he wants you to sell imperial fighters to a pirate, but he answers: "No, it isn't precisely that. In fact, we are looking to a contact with the FLF. Do you think, you can do it?"]]

   Maybe try to disable a FLF ship, board it and explain to it's crew what we want. If you success, set up a meeting in %s. I think, nobody is going to disturb us there.
