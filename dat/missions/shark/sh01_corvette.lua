He saw your fight against the Ancestor, but he would like to see a Shark beating a destroyer class ship. Of course, Nexus Shipyards don't want to take the risk to make you face a destroyer with a Shark.
   So, we have an other plan: we need somebody to pretend to be an outlaw destroyer pilot and to let one of our men disable his ship. If you are ready for it, all you have to do is to jump in %s with a destroyer class ship and to let the Shark disable you. As there isn't any Empire bounty this time, you will only be paid %s credits.
