## Nebula Strandees Campaign

An entry point into Proteron culture (not the main campaign). The player encounters a bunch of Proteron stranded in an isolated and inescapable -- at least, by conventional means -- pocket of the Nebula. The player, who is also stranded, finds a way out with the help of the strandees.

### Mission Overview

1. **ns01:** investigate the jump point after getting a map from a scavenger.
2. **ns02:** the player is trapped and makes contact with the Proteron strandees.
3. **ns03:** collect equipment from two drones to power an experimental drive to take them out.
4. **ns04:** give the drive a test; it fails.
5. **ns05:** new and improved drive needs different components, can only be taken from ships. Retrieve them from two SPA ships
   * bob: strip the components, killing the people; ship becomes hostile when stripped (automated systems), has to be defeated and boarded to complete
   * Jen: hack the ships, make contact with survivors and retrieve components (no fight, only minigame)
6. **ns06:** finale. Leave the system. Empire ships guard the exit. Either turn over the refugees on board or lie and keep them safe.
