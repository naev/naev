   Mission: Advanced Nebula Research
   
   Description: This time the post doc asks the player for help. Reference data of further nebula are needed to understand the Sol nebula. The player has to escort a refitted transport ship through pirate and dvaered space.
   
   Difficulty: Medium

We have already installed his sensors on a transport ship. The nearby PSO nebula should be a good candidate but there are the pirate systems inbetween. Also the target systems are controled by the Dvaered. Hard to say wheter the dvaered or the pirates are more dangerous. So this is why we need an escort.
