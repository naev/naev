   Mission: The one with the Shopping

   Description: A Za'lek scientist asks the player to fetch some raw material that he needs to build his prototype.
   Multiple systems have to be visited and materials acquired from contact persons in the bar. 

   Difficulty: Easy to Medium? Depending on whether the player lingers around too much and gets caught.
