-- MISSION: The one with the Visit
-- DESCRIPTION: Dr. Geller asks you to disable a Soromid ship to retrieve some technology
-- that he needs for his prototype. Za'lek science can obviously not fall behind Soromid.
-- Obviously Soromid will not like this and will try to attack the player.
--
-- Difficulty: Easy to Medium?

-- Author: fart but based on Mission Ideas in wiki: wiki.naev.org/wiki/Mission_Ideas
