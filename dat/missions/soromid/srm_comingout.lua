    "H-hi! N-nice to meet you. I'm... um, you know what, you can just call me 'C' for now. I'm not sure about the name yet. They/them pronouns if that's okay." You agree to the request, introduce yourself, and chat with them a bit. They seem like a nice person.
    After a while, C crosses their arms in thought. "So... um, you're a pilot, you say, right? Thing is, I'm in need of some transportation, but I don't really have much money on me so no one's willing to take me. It's a bit far and there's a lot of pirates in the area, so I get why no one wants to do it, but you know... I just... I need to see my parents. Just something I need to tell them. I'm not picky about how long it takes, and I promise I won't cause any trouble.... Could you do this for me?"]])

"It's a bit nerve-wracking, coming out to my parents, and I've met so many people who... anyway, it's nice to meet someone who understands and respects my wishes and doesn't react with sarcasm. I hope my parents understand...."
    After confirming that it's about the pronouns you use to refer to them that they're talking about, you simply say that it should be common decency to respect people's wishes regarding how they wish to be referred to. This leads to a conversation about common decency and people who do rude things for no good reason.]])

chatter[2] = _([[C perks up. "Can I tell you something?" You respond affirmatively. "Thank you," they say. "I was going to come out to my parents first, but I'm so nervous and... I feel safe coming out to you, you know? Since you've been so nice to me this entire time.
    "I was assigned male at birth, and society tends to see me as a man. But I've come to the conclusion that... I'm transgender. I feel like I should be... a woman, I think? I'm not sure. Does... does that make sense? I'm not stupid, am I?" You respond that, no, they're not stupid; everyone is different and no one can know C better than they can. C seems relieved to hear this.]])

chatter[3] = _([["Hey... is there any chance, um... I know I asked you to use they/them pronouns for me before, but could you use she/her pronouns instead, please? I hope that's not too much trouble...." You assure her that it's no trouble at all and the two of you have a rather long and interesting conversation about the place of pronouns in society. You can tell that she's a lot happier and more comfortable than she was before.]])

chatter[4] = _([["I've given it some thought," C says. "I think... my new name, I like the sound of 'Chelsea'." You respond that it sounds like a nice name, plastering a smile on Chelsea's face.]])

    As it turns out, Chelsea has arranged to see her parents at the bar. When you arrive, Chelsea's parents immediately recognize and greet her, calling her by a different name. A look of sadness appears on Chelsea's face as she hears this, but she quickly hides it and her parents don't seem to notice. Chelsea greets her parents, introduces you as her friend, then sits down. You sit down next to her.]])

    Chelsea laughs nervously. "There's something I have to tell you," she says. "I, um... I'm transgender. I would like for you to call me Chelsea and refer to me with she/her pronouns from now on... if that's okay."
    Chelsea's father responds immediately and briefly. "Sure," he says. "I don't have any problem with that. However you dress or whatever name you use, that's fine by me."
    Her mother is silent for a moment, then gets up out of her chair. Chelsea gets up as well, a look of fear in her eyes, then a look of surprise as her mother locks her in an embrace. She hugs her mother back and starts to sob. "I'm proud of you, Chelsea," her mother says. Out of Chelsea's view, her father shrugs and finishes his drink.]])

landtext[3] = _([[After Chelsea's mother releases her, she wipes a few tears from her eyes and gives you a friendly hug. "Thank you," she says. "You've been a great friend and joining me here has been a great help." She lets go of you. "I'm sure you must be busy! But hey, do come back once in a while, OK? I'm going to stick around on this planet for the time being. It'll be nice to see you again!"
    Taking your cue, you say goodbye for now, excuse yourself from the table, and make your way back to your ship. As you enter your cockpit you find a credit chip worth %s credits! It's not much, but it's something.]])
