    Chelsea perks up a little. "So, remember I said I had ambitions of a pilot? Well, I have my piloting license already, but I'm kind of poor so I couldn't afford my first ship. So I've been asking around and I've managed to find a great deal for a used ship at %s in the %s system! I just need someone to take me there. Again, no rush. Would you be able to do that for me?"]])

She seems to know exactly where to go and before you even know what's going on, she's purchased an old Llama, possibly the most rusty and worn-down Llama you've ever seen, but in working order nonetheless. You express concern about the condition of the ship, but she assures you that she will fix it up as she gets enough money to do so. She hugs you in a friendly embrace, thanks you, and hands you a credit chip. "Catch up with me again sometime, okay? I'll be hanging out in Soromid space doing my first missions as a pilot!" As you walk away, you see her getting her first close-up look at the mission computer with a look of excitement in her eyes.]])
