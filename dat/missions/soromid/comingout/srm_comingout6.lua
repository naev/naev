I'm supposed to be getting a better ship soon, but it's going to be difficult." You ask them why that is. "Well, I came across someone who's offering me a bargain on a new ship! Well, not new exactly. It's used, but in much better condition than that rust bucket I got before. Supposedly this guy used to be a Dvaered warlord and is offering me his old Vigilance if I just take care of this one pirate known as %s. Trouble is they're piloting a ship that's stronger than my own...."
