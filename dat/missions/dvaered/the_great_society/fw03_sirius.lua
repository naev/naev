The only one I'm worried about is Colonel Hamelsen: it will be very difficult for her to find a position with a warlord since they prefer to have people they know at higher ranks, and the DHC only rarely recruits new colonels.

A confirmed victory is recorded when you, alone, destroy any kind of enemy warship. As we tend to work in squads, we pretty often destroy ships without scoring any confirmed victories. My first victory was a Pirate Hyena. The pilot was probably drunk or something. They headed right towards my Vendetta, broadcasting stupid taunts. My sergeant was nice and left the Hyena all to me. My second victory was against a freak... I mean a local warlord's pilot who claimed she could kill any DHC pilot in fair fight. Apparently, it was not true.
