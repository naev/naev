   Clearly this is a pirate looking to make a few credits off your dire situation. But, the idea is not a bad one. The Imperial ships wouldn't be looking for a ship with a Skulls and Bones fake transponder. So you ask him how many credits he wants. "{number}" is the answer. "Sounds like a lot, right? But maybe it's a bargain in exchange for your life and the success of whatever unscrupulous mission you're trying to carry out. Maybe you don't have that many credits on you right now. That's OK. I'll accept your word to pay me at some point. Well, your word and your DNA signature. That way I can find you if you try to cheat me."

Hamfresser, his face as pale as death, sits on the ground, leaning on a pillar, busy changing a ragged, blood-soaked bandage on his left arm. Sergeant Nikolov stares at a huge hole in her foot with a vacant eye and the medic, Therus, limps from one soldier to another leaving a trail of bloody handprints on the walls.
   Lying in the centre of the room, covered with bandages, is private Tronk. His battle armour, pierced with multiple holes, has been tossed a few metres away in a puddle of blood. With a sad smile, the soldier gazes at the two remaining fingers of his less damaged arm that are slowly walking on the ground. "Leopold, you remember when you were a kid? Did you play with your fingers like that?" Hamfresser answers: "Tronky-boy, don't use my first name, only dying people have used my first name before..." "Don't be afraid, this won't change, Leopold."
   Suddenly, the soldier opens his eyes wide and calls the medic: "Therus! I know why Major Tam can catch the turtle! Each time, when he reaches the point where the turtle previously was, the time he needs for that is smaller. And at some point, it becomes so infinitely small that even if you have an infinity of steps to go, the total time is finite." The medic looks at the dying man: "Tronky, how did you? Tronky?" She then stops and takes the pulse at Tronk's neck "It's over, captain." Hamfresser answers: "Damn! He's the fifth kid to die under my command and it still hurts as much.

Fortunately for me, he just pierced my lung. That is a replaceable part.
