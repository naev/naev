-- Dvaered Meeting
-- This is the 5th mission of the Frontier War Dvaered campaign.
-- The player has to secure a Dvaered Warlord Meeting.
-- Hamelsen lures out the player, while Strafer gets killed by a spy who runs away.
-- There are two parts in the mission : part 1 is mainly contemplative, and part 2 is tricky, with fights and so.

   Stages :
   0) Way to Dvaer Prime
   1) Briefing at Dvaer Prime and patrol around DHC
   2) Following Hamelsen towards Laars (main purpose of this is to let the player save the game because second part is tricky)
   3) Taking off from Laars
   4) Land on Laars and get rewarded

lore_text[1] = _([["Both squadrons of the DHC station's space security force will be deployed with a full range ships from Vendettas to Goddards. Those squadrons are the 'Beta-Storks' and the 'Beta-Hammer' and their mission will be to control medium and heavy ships and to provide heavy firepower in case of need. Our squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.
   "The plan is the following: any ship approaching the station will be assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is assigned to you, you will have to approach the ship within 1000 km. Their security clearance code will be automatically requested and processed by the system we'll install in your core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to fly away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.
   "Finally, in case something unexpected happens, you will, of course, have to obey orders. Watch your messages closely. A few pilots will be kept in reserve close to the station.
   "Oh, and there is another thing I must warn you about: it's the warlord's odd sense of humour. When they see a small ship close to their Goddard, they may get the idea to shoot a small railgun-volley in your direction. Some of them tend to enjoy seeing pilots fend for their lives. Dvaered law allows warlords to do so provided they can assure the High Command that there was no hostile intention. That can be a bit annoying, sometimes."]])

lore_text[2] = _([[When you mention Colonel Hamelsen, Strafer cuts you off: "Ex-Colonel Hamelsen! She is a traitor and has lost all her commendations. Now she is nothing to the Dvaered, and things are better like that." You ask him if things may have turned differently for her and he answers:
   "Watch out, citizen: these kinds of questions lead to compassion. Compassion leads to weakness and weakness leads to death. Death for yourself and for those who trusted you. Death for your leaders and for your subordinates. Death for people you love and people you respect. Remember: if you want to be strong, don't listen to compassion. Don't even give compassion a chance to reach your heart."]])

One just has to have achieved the '9th grade commendation', and to conquer a planet (or a station). In the army, every rank gives you a commendation grade, for example, I have the 3rd grade. Civilians also obtain commendation for their high deeds; you obtained the 1st grade commendation for your involvement in the FLF destruction, if I am right. The 9th grade commendation, that is associated to the rank of first-class General in the army, gives the right to own a military base, and by extension, to be granted regal power over a region.
   "In the Dvaered army, everybody starts as a raw soldier, no matter if you're an infantryman, a pilot, a medic, or even a General's child. And only Valor decides how quick you rise in the hierarchy. Warlord is the ultimate rank for the military and for private combat pilots, like yourself)"]])
