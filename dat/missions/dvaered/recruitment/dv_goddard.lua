--[[
-- Dvaered Negotiation 1
-- This is the mission of the Dvaered Recruitment arc when the player has to help a Warlord getting a second Goddard Battleship.
-- The player has to transport commandos to sabotage a ship's engine in a hangar.
-- Things don't go as expected and player has to intercept a ship (pretending to need fuel) and let the commandos board.
-- Afterwards, the player needs to kill a pirate shark with a Llama. Rem: if another dummy yacht gets added in the future, it could be added

   Stages :
   0) Way to Halir to search for the engine
   1) Way to Arcturus to intercept the transport Koala
   2) Interception of the Koala
   3) Way to Zhiru to deposit back the commandos
   4) Way to Zacron to get intercepted by the pirate Shark
   5) Battle
   6) Way back for getting paid
