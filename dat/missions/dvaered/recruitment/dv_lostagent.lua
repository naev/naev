   Dvaered Delivery
   This is the mission of the Dvaered Recruitment arc when the player starts to commit with Dvaered.
   The player has to transmit a parcel to another private pilot on Zhiru. The destination of the parcel is the Empire.
   But the other pilot is missing and the player has to do a series of tasks.
   At some point, the FLF is suspected to have abducted the agent (pretext to get the player enemy with them)

   Stages :
   0) Way to Zhiru to meet Dvaered contact agent
   1) Way to Caladan to meet Empire contact agent
   2) Going to speak to the contact agent
   3) Way to Theras and ambush on the FLF Tristan
   4) Battle at Theras
   5) After the Battle against the Swan
   6) Kill the true killer of the lost agent
   7) Battle
   8) Way back to any Dvaered planet to get paid
