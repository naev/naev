-- Dvaered Census 0
-- This is the first mission of the Dvaered Recruitment arc
-- (facultative missions that make the player close to the Dvaered
-- and end up allowing them to purchase heavy weapons and ships licences).
-- The player has to get in range of a given amount of Dvaered Ships in a given system.

   Stages :
   0) Way to system and in-system traffic
   1) Way to any Dvaered Spob to get paid

Most of the Dvaered warships you see out there do belong to private armies, that obey to generals, called the 'Warlords'. Those Warlords have many privileges, but they also have some obligations. One of those obligations is to patrol routes around the worlds they own.
But as the Dvaered are a bit… primitive, their administration is not able to control that they actually protect the trade lanes. That is why they need private pilots, like us, to count Dvaered ships."]]))

Once you have seen enough ships, you can land on any Dvaered-controlled planet to transmit your data and collect your pay."]]))

So, after the reparations were completed, I went to Dvaered space. But I didn't find anybody who could install this coating on my ship yet. And what is more, I suspect this will cost much more that I can afford. So I do missions for the Dvaered in order to make money and explore a bit."]]))

As they cannot be adapted together by default, I got a friend on Em5 to machine a special adaptor.
"Anyway, so the repairman on Brooks didn't have the needed parts to repair my hull and I had to get someone to transport me to Darkshed. You know, it's the best place to find spare parts for older models of ships as nebula scavengers often sell their findings there. But once there, I met Robin. Do you know Robin?
She is small, wants to kill me, has curly brunette hair and a smiling round head. You are sure you don't know her? She talked a lot about killing me lately. Anyway, I managed to hide in a rubbish bin, but unfortunately, I got loaded by mistake on a garbage ship heading to that stinky planet in Soromid space, you know? I got lucky I was in a pressurized compartment, and I managed to get out in Father's Pride.
And after that I got an inter-system call from the repairman in Brooks who actually found the needed set of parts (it was in a crate he was using to wedge his desk). So I returned, had a bath and got my repaired ship!"]]))
