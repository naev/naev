-- Dvaered Negotiation 2
-- This is the second mission of the Dvaered Recruitment arc when the player has to help a Warlord getting a second Goddard Battleship.
-- The player needs to please Baron Sauterfeldt, who is a shareholder of Goddard. For that, player has to steal a nozzle hubcap to a Hyena gang leader.
-- First, the player has to defy the gang's deputee leader in a deadly race named the "Hallway to Hell"
-- Afterwards, the leader accepts a death fight with the player, who has to disable her and steal the nozzle hubcap.

   Stages :
   0) Way to Ulios to encounter the Baron
   1) Way to Norpin II in Norpin for the biker's convention
   2) Taking off for the "Hallway to Hell" with Big Bunny Benny
   3) Land back on Norpin II
   4) Discussions on Norpin II
   5) Taking off for the duel with Blue Belly Billy
   6) Way back to Ulios for getting paid
