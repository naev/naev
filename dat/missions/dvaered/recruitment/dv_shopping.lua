-- Dvaered Shopping
-- This is the last mission of the Dvaered Recruitment arc.
-- The player escorts the fleet of Colonel Okran in route to Zhiru in Goddard.
-- Mission is really straightforward, until, on Goddard, the Trickster appears and reveals that Lord Fatgun has been assassinated.
-- Okran tries to kill the player with the Goddard cruiser and player meets the trickster.

   Stages :
   0) Way to Zhiru
   1) Way back
   2) Way to trickster rendezvous and kill Okran
   3) Way to any Dvaered planet to get rewarded

No, of course not! Now that Lord Fatassâ€¦ Fatgun died, all his soldiers have been put to the Dvaered Military Reserve, and Okran don't command them anymore. Officially, he was also sent to the Reserve, but custom needs him to avenge his lord first, by at least killing one person (you). So he will be flying an unescorted Goddard.
And as they teach at school, an unescorted capship is a dead capship. I recommend using a corvette with torpedoes. Unless of course you have another capship stronger than a Dvaered Goddard. Of course. Hewhewhew!"]]))
