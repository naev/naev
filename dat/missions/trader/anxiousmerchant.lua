   Anxious Merchant
   Author: PhoenixRiver (from an idea on the wiki)

   A merchant with a slow ship suddenly realizes he can't make the delivery and
   implores the player to do it for him. Since he has to look good with his
   employers he'll pay the player a bonus if he does it.

   Note: Variant of the Drunkard and Rush Cargo missions combined
