   Anxious Merchant
   Author: PhoenixRiver (from an idea on the wiki)

   A merchant with a slow ship suddenly realizes he can't make the delivery and
   implores the player to do it for him. Since he has to look good with his
   employers he'll pay the player a bonus if he does it.

   Note: Variant of the Drunkard and Rush Cargo missions combined

I'm in the Sol nebula without a shield generator."
    "Don't worry so much dude, I'm sure they'll cut you some slack if you're back only a little late", you say reassuringly. "The hell they will! If I don't get this %d tons of %s to %s the next guy's gonna be late and then the customer will be on us and we'll all get it from management, geeze... but that's a thought, if someone else gets it there in time then at least I'll only get a bit of grief... hey, you wouldn't take this stuff for me would you? It's needs to get to the %s system in %s, could you do that for me? I'd sure appreciate it!]]

We've been shifting stuff around to make up for it and then you come waltzing in here... where the heck is the guy that was supposed to bring this stuff?? The one who was supposed to bring us this damn stuff???" A group of workers rushes along with the Inspector and you as you try to explain what happened on the way to unload your ship. "Bugger that! He's damn'd well fired and if I see him again there's gonna be another damn Incident!!!"
    You wait to one side as the cargo is hauled off your ship at breakneck speed and wonder if you shouldn't have just dumped the stuff in space. Just as the last of the cargo is taken off your ship the Inspector, who has clearly cooled off a bit, comes up to you and says "Look, I know you were trying to do us a favour but next time don't bother if you can't make it on time, but thank you for delivering the stuff at all; we've had one or two wazzocks who just dumped it all in space", then he snears, "Didn't take long for it to catch up to them though..."
