### Notes

* Peeling is the equivalent to "doxxing" in the Onion Society.
* The Onion Society motto is "Going to make you cry!"
* Message capsules are small autonomous drones that jump back and forth through jump lanes to transmit information at speeds faster than light, with also quantum entangling at a system level. Having priority access through them is really expensive, and most information and data is transmitted at much slower speeds.
* The Nexus is the equivalent to cyberspace, although it is much more heterogeneous and inconsistent as it is mainly patched through sneaking packets into messages and hacked message capsules.
