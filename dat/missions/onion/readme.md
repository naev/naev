### Mission Overview

1. **onion01:** weird mission computer that gives errors. On accept, gives an error and spawns another mission computer mission. Have to deliver a package to Gordon's Exchange. Causes havoc on the station.
2. **onion02:** hacked ship contacts player, gives mission to pick up package at Ulios (Ingot) and deliver to Frontier Council. When about to get activated, l337_b01 stops it and ousts the mission giver. Player then is told instead deliver package to DVNN Central. Havoc is wreaked across the Dvaered News Network.
3. **onion03:** l337_b01 asks the player for help setting up short through a relay and then the player invited to a conclave in the Nexus and sees the power dynamics of the Onion Society.
4. **onion04:** l337_b01 invites the player to do a bank heist with them. Player has to steal some one-time pads and interface with the bank network.
5. **onion05:** player is sent get some Empire network plans for something big. Halfway through this is interrupted by a news event where signal is captured, where Trixie is peeled (doxxed). Have to rush to save Trixie, but ends up in failure and their death
6. **onion06:** emergency conclave in the Nexus regarding Trixie where more tensions flare
7. **onion07:** l337_b01 asks the player to help them find out who peeled Trixie, and use the Empire network plans recovered before to try to figure how the signal was hacked. Seems to indicate one of notasockpuppet's puppets, but not sure if manipulated. DOG sends a message warning l337_b01 that this is a dangerous path.
8. **onion08:** l337_b01 ignores the warning and gets the player to try to break into of notasockpuppets puppets to see if that was the cause, however, gets complicated
9. **onion09:** another tense emergency conclave in the Nexus, l337_b01 gets peeled and have to go save them
9. **onion10:** Recover the package at Gordon's Exchange
10. **onion11:** Plant trap signal generator and defend it while l337_b01 captures the signal
11. **onion12:** final showdown at underworlder's centre of operations station. Eventually DOG comes and helps out
12. **onion13:** epilogue where the player gets control of the station and can do a single jump to a location while DOG disappears into the Nebula


### Notes

* **Peeling** is the equivalent to "doxxing" in the Onion Society.
* The Onion Society motto is *"Going to make you cry!"* and they meet in Conclaves
* Message capsules are small autonomous drones called "**Nexus Relays**" or just "**Relays**" that jump back and forth through jump lanes to transmit information at speeds faster than light, with also quantum entangling at a system level. Having priority access through them is really expensive, and most information and data is transmitted at much slower speeds. Bypassing the mechanism is known as **shorting**.
* **The Nexus** is the equivalent to cyberspace, although it is much more heterogeneous and inconsistent as it is mainly patched through sneaking packets into messages and hacked message capsules.


### Ultra Spoilers: History of the Onion Society

In a nutshell, 7 hackers (DOG, lonewolf4, notasockpuppet, l337_b01, underworlder, v3c70r, and Trixie) stumbled upon the long lost Nexus backbone around 500 UST (100 cycles before start of the game), which allows full control of the entire inter-galactic network. They didn't trust each other and split the keys using advanced cryptography (Multisignature Cryptography + Dead Man's Switch + Smart Contract), with each member being designed a **Keeper of the Secrets** (usually referred to as keeper) and forming the Onion Society.

Most of the time they are hacking freely and enjoying their arguments with each other, however, an important event that happens is **Operation Dissonance** that changes the fate of the society.

#### Operation Dissonance (Roughly 530 UST)

1. Hackers find some clues of fishy things going on at **Tenebros Station** while tracking some refugee diversion database changes.
1. Hacking into the systems of the station, it is found that the local governor is experimenting with mind-control drugs on a large scale on the station as part of a secret Imperial project.
1. l337_b01 and v3c70r go in person, faking being members of the project to get more direct access, while DEADBEEF (not original 7, disciple of l337_b01) and Trixie stay back providing support.
1. Find out the project is in the last stage and about to trigger the sleeping agent in all inhabitants of the station, much sooner than anticipatedi due to a screw up by DEADBEEF.
1. In order to stop greater harm and infiltration in the rest of society, they decide to disable life support and sabotage the systems. Due to complications, v3c70r is killed, and l337_b01, seeing their own end near, entrust DEADBEEF to continue their legacy by passing all private codes in a last act.
1. Trixie takes neural feedback in a desperate attempt to save l337_b01, which results in early onset Alzheimers.
1. DEADBEEF hacks database, swapping identities with l337_b01, and doxing his old self (now l337_b01).
1. lonewolf4 had family on the station, and had not noticed anything nor participated in the operation. Taken over by grief, blames l337_b01 as the mentor of DEADBEEF for letting this happen.

#### Fallout

The loss of v3c70r brings the number of keys necessary to break the Nexus backbone to 6. Animosity between lonewolf4 and l337_b01 splits the Onion Society into more factional groups and less cooperation.

The hackers age, and the toil on their body grows, resulting in most of them making use of high tech systems to extend their life as much as possible.
