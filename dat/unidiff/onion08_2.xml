  <description>Enveloped in a permanent abrasive and unpredictable planetary storm, it is near impossible to get close to the surface. You can only view the beautiful patterns from low orbit, which are quite mesmerizing to say the least. Out of curiosity you try to see if your scanners can pick up any remains of the Wolfie, but it seems like they have been eroded away in a short period of time.</description>
