  <description>Enveloped in a permanent abrasive and unpredictable planetary storm, it is near impossible to get close to this planet's surface. You're determined to make your first attempt the last, and stick to viewing the mesmerizing patterns in the atmosphere from low orbit. Out of curiosity you try to see if your scanners can pick up any remains of the Wolfie, but it seems to have been grinded away into dust in little time.</description>
