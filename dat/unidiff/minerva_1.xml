 <spob name="Minerva Station">
  <description>The station consists of essentially one gigantic gambling complex. While it is usually a very high-energy frenetic environment full of gambling, the station seems to be in a partially locked down state full of Imperial bureaucrats running around. It's not really clear what is going on, but at least nobody seems to give you a second look so you are quite free to move around the station.</description>
  <bar>Like most of the station, the bar is directly built into the gambling complex. It's mainly empty except for some bureaucrats and personnel who seem to be taking a break from whatever they are doing.</bar>
