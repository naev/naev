  <description>Fuzka is a fairly typical Imperial civilian world. It has a good atmosphere, stable tectonics and a large population. The world grows most of its own food but still needs imports to make ends meet. The local population is as well off as can be expected from a middle-class Imperial colony. Otherwise, there is little to note about Fuzka.</description>
  <bar>The bar caters to its clientele with considerable efficiency. Since Fuzka has quite a high amount of civilian traffic, its bar needs to handle the many passengers who are waiting for their transport to depart.</bar>
