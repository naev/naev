  <description>Brooks is a bustling, highly populated Imperial civilian planet. With the decline of the Empire, it has found itself on the border of dangerous space, a rather uncomfortable position. As Brooks is a rich planet with a lot of economic and political weight within the Empire, the Imperial Navy protects Arcturus for Brooks' sake, as much as for the Imperial core systems.</description>
