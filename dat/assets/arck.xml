  <description>With nine billion inhabitants, Arck is one of the most densely populated worlds in the galaxy. Most of the planet's surface is covered by a gigantic, sprawling city. Naturally, with so much habitation comes massive environmental pollution, many skeptics believe that what the Dvaered are doing here is a form of reverse terraforming - an attempt to turn Arck into an X class planet.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport on Arck is located right in the middle of a particularly densely populated urban hub. The associated bar has been expanded and turned into a general leisure facility for the local inhabitants, something that often irritates traders who come here to do business, only to find themselves in the middle of a Dvaered Turborave party.</bar>
