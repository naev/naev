  <description>Despite being hellish, Golem has a respectably large population, albeit a population restricted to hab units at the top of mountains. The gasses here are useful, and hence mined, but the world is not harsh enough to justify making it a prison planet. Many lower-class Dvaered make their homes here, unperturbed by the conditions. It's a living, after all.</description>
  <bar>This bar is shockingly convivial and clean, all things considered. The locals are determined to make their lives that much more enjoyable, and to prove to outsiders that they can conquer their homeworld's harsh environment.</bar>
