  <description>Dono is one of the more laid-back Soromid worlds. It is quite Earth-like, and the Soromid make use of the strange properties of the local flora and fauna for their genetic experiments. It is a quiet world, with little to stand out about it.</description>
  <bar>The bar is patronised by scientists, laborers and regular civilians, mingling with little conflict. The service is acceptable and the food and drink pass par. A sleepy bar, that's for sure.</bar>
