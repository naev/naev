  <description>All water on Cristen is toxic and, as such, the planet is inhospitable to all but the most hardy forms of life. However, the toxicity of the water system also means that certain substances can be obtained very easily here. Due to this the settlement on Cristen is one giant complex, isolated from the outside environment.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport bar is one of the best protected facilities on the planet. The local government considers the lives of potential trading partners of greater importance than the lives of its workers. Having said that they do get to wear hazard suits outside of the main domes and they get a rather nice bar too - certainly not something many Dvaereds can claim.</bar>
