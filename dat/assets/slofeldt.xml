  <description>Slofeldt is a floating museum and memorial to the Incident. It contains relics from Old Earth, as well as holos of Sol before the Incident sterilized it. It is a monument to last and remind people of days gone by. A place for quiet contemplation.</description>
  <bar>The bar is more of a restaurant, with overpriced if tasty food and drinks both alcoholic and otherwise. The beer is brewed on site, and has a surprising kick to it.</bar>
