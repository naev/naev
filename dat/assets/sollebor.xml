  <description>Sollebor stands a long way from its primary, and thus is a cold planet. Astronomists think that it was originally a gas giant, but it cooled so much that it collapsed into a solid sphere. They think this because the icy landscape is composed largely of frozen methane. The frozen methane provides for a lucrative mining business.</description>
  <bar>Like most of the planet's habitation complex, the spaceport bar is subterranean. It is well heated, so it doesn't really seem like you're on a frozen ball of methane at all.</bar>
