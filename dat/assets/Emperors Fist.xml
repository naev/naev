  <description>Emperor's Fist is intended to be the new homeworld of the Emperor himself since the last one was destroyed in the Incident. It's a massive project that is attempting to completely transform a C-class world into that which is suitable for the highest ranks of the Empire's aristocracy. Currently it possesses few amenities beyond the Starport.</description>
  <bar>The bar is designed for those working on the terraforming project. Small compared to many planetary bars, it nonetheless has a steady flow of patrons, largely consisting of off-duty terraforming workers.</bar>
