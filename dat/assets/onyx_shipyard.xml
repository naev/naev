  <description>The Onyx Shipyard is a modern, high-tech shipyard. At least by Dvaered standards. The place builds both combat and trade vessels, and commissions a portion of the Dvaered fleet. Several Warlords also have personal contracts at Onyx, drawing ships for their private fleets from here.</description>
  <bar>Each table in the spaceport bar is themed around a ship design that is manufactured here. Some are even built out of old or faulty components of the ships in question. Of course it's not very artistic, considering that a Dvaered came up with it, but there's still a certain class to it that gets potential buyers in the mood.</bar>
