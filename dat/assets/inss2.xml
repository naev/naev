  <description>INSS-2, or Imperial Nutrient Supply Station 2, was built in this remote secion of space to compensate for the lack of farming output in the sector. Food is not a very profitable commodity to trade over long distances, and the colonies in Nartur found themselves limited in their growth due to chronic shortages. INSS-2 has allowed them to grow.</description>
  <bar>Trim and functional, the bar here is situated in the central growing dome of INSS-2. The windows look out on vast stretches of multi-layered crop beds, and there's always a harvester to be seen at work somewhere out there.</bar>
