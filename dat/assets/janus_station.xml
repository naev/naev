  <description>Janus Station is a quiet garrison post for the empire. It serves as a potential rallying point for imperial forces trying to defend the core, but at the moment, it is considered an acceptable post for older crewmen wanting a relaxing post before they retire to Amphion not far away.</description>
  <bar>The bar has a few games on, and the drinks are cold. There is food, but it is mostly pre-packaged stuff. Not bad, but not amazing either.</bar>
