  <description>Nanek is a rarity in Dvaered space: a world devoted to something other than mining. Despite being mostly desert and ocean, Nanek is a popular retirement point for soldiers, officers, and anyone else who can afford it. This makes it a very popular world for warlords to conquer, and fighting here is endemic. No warlord is bold enough to interfere with the relaxed lifestyles of the locals, however.</description>
  <bar>The average age of the patrons here seems to be late middle age. Their senses have not dulled with time, however, and you feel their eyes boring into you as you sit down. But they seem friendly enough after a while.</bar>
