  <description>Adham is a cold, lifeless planet. The only reason a landing strip is here at all is that the planet hosts the three arctic-themed arenas for Totoran's gladiatorial games. While the landing zone and a small buffer around it is considered neutral territory, most of the planet's surface is subject to the destructive sport that is so popular among Totoran's visitors.</description>
