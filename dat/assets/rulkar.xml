  <description>Rulk'ar is a mining-world with a strong presence of Za'lek universities thanks to its rather isolated nature aesthetic view. It is a center of terraforming research, turning an already inhabitable planet into a full class-M world. Many burnt out Za'lek researchers come here to get more in touch with nature and get away from the intense research schedules they have back at their research centers, and quite a few never return.</description>
  <bar>This bar has holopaintings of some of Rulk'ar's breathtaking canyons, mountains, and skyline, as well as the progress on the world's terraforming. The laid-back and casual ambience is also very fitting.</bar>
