  <description>This Class-O planet is another purely residential planet in Za'lek space, with a rather large population and several university campuses. The standard of living is rather high, and life expectancy is long, making it a popular place to live out a retirement. Other than that, there isn't much to recommend it to adventurers. Which is just how many of the inhabitants like it.</description>
  <bar>This bar bears a closer resemblance to a family restaurant, with the average patron being about late middle age.</bar>
