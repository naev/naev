  <description>The colony on Takeru was founded as part of an Imperial colonization program. However, the government at the time deemed the colony to be a failure, and refused to grant it Imperial status. Since then, the colonists have governed themselves.</description>
  <bar>What is a spaceport bar? A miserable pile of drink, noise, data terminals, and of course the occasional fight. Takeru's bar has all of these components, which makes it a comfortable place to be for anyone with more than a few light years under his belt.</bar>
