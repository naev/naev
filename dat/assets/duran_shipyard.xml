  <description>Duran Shipyard produces light support craft used by the Dvaered military machine. It also has a line of civilian and cargo ships which it makes available to retailers and consumers. Since the ships produced here are combat-ready and the facility always has at least one completed squadron standing by, Duran Shipyard is an important contributor to the stability in the region.</description>
  <bar>The spacedock bar provides visitors with a view over part of the assembly line. It is quite impressive to see a spacecraft being built, even if it is only a relatively small one.</bar>
