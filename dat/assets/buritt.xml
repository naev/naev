  <description>Not as nice as Varia in the Darkstone system, Buritt is nevertheless a reasonably habitable world. You will find much of the Dvaered middle class here, such as it is. You will also find a large-scale pollution of the natural environment, but the Dvaered being Dvaered, no attempt is being made to address this.</description>
