  <description>Though a fairly unobtrusive world filled with lower-middle class Dvaered citizens, the Dvaered authorities nevertheless pay close attention to what goes on on Sternguard. Close to the Sirian border, the world is a prime candidate for conversion. At the moment the population seems to be stable, but the Dvaered know better than to relax their guard.</description>
