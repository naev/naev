  <description>Rodney is a world where precious gems are mined and sold further south to bolster the Soromid economy. The planet also grows several valuable crops, and is mined for valuable minerals. While this makes it a valuable addition to the Soromid economy, it makes it an aggressively dull place to live.</description>
  <bar>You see several rich magnates and merchant lords in this bar, talking business or making small talk. The sheer pompousness of the scene makes you want to run out the door screaming.</bar>
