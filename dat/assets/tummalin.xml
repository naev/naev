  <description>Tummalin is the base of operations of a small mining company. Its primary, Longbow III, is rich in various unusual substances. However, the planet itself is far too unstable to permit a permanent presence, so all mining operations are carried out with mobile harvester ships. It's dangerous work, but as long as there's a market there will always be someone willing to do it.</description>
  <bar>The bar has a window that looks out over the main docks for the harvester ships that the miners use to collect resources from the planet below. The ships are ugly and battered, but they are always kept in prime working condition. A malfunction on the surface of Longbow III can quickly lead to the deaths of all crew.</bar>
