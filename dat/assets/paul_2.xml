  <description>Paul 2 is a planet of merchants and entrepreneurs. Though the planet doesn't have a global government as such, the population has agreed on a number of general rules that count as law of some sort. It works surprisingly well.</description>
  <bar>Like many planets in the galaxy nowadays, Paul 2's economy relies heavily on interplanetary trade. The spaceport bar doubles as a trade center, allowing traders to buy and sell wares without ever leaving the spaceport.</bar>
