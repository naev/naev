  <description>A small moon orbiting Sarcophagus II, Ebenezer's atmosphere is deadly to humans and Soromid alike. However, the Soromid discovered that their biological ships quite like it here and a few weeks of continued exposure makes their outer skins tougher and more resistant to damage. Most Soromid military ships will make a visit to Ebenezer early on in their lives for this reason.</description>
  <bar>There's really not too much to do on Ebenezer. The Soromid who live here permanently are here to oversee the ships tethered to the surface and their population isn't large enough to present much of a market. Traders don't often come to this place.</bar>
