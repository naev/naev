  <description>August is a fairly standard, if cold, world. Rarely for a Za'lek planet, it doesn't have that many research stations on it. IT is almost purely a residential world, primarily for the scientists working on Warnecke who, after a hard week's work, don't want to see another lab for a while.</description>
  <bar>This bar has the feel of an old-world pub, with plenty of wood furnishing on display, good food and better beer. A great place to relax and unwind.</bar>
