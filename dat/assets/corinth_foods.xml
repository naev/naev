  <description>Corinth foods is a primary source of food for the Za'lek worlds. The Za'lek's advanced farming techniques means that this relatively small station is capable of feeding a large number of people. Shuttles frequently stop and go here, and a number of scientists use this station as ground zero for many botany experiments.</description>
  <bar>The bar is clean and relatively elaborate, with plants of all kind in the windows. The bartender needs several assistants to keep up with the demand for food and drink.</bar>
