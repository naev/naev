  <description>It's a nickname, of course. How could it not be? Trouble is, nobody remembers where the name came from, and, bizarrely, there are no records of the station's original name. It's quite a famous story, both within Hekaras and elsewhere. Meanwhile, all involved simply call it Three and a half Kings. It seems to work for them.</description>
  <bar>This is a typical stationside bar. It has viewports looking into space, which are of course ignored by everyone, since anyone who comes to a station like this has seen all the space they could possibly want to.</bar>
