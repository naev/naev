  <description>Facett Outpost is little more than a local police station. It was created as a precaution against the pirate threat coming from Khaas, but the Soromid know that no one station could withstand a coordinated attack. Facett is mostly a visible sign of Soromid presence in Hatter. It puts the local population at peace. The real security has to come from Hartwell Station in neighbor system Father's Pride.</description>
  <bar>The bar is where the local security employees go when they're on standby. They seldom have to wait for a long time before their assistance is required.</bar>
