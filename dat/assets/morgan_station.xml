  <description>Morgan Station serves as a valuable staging area in this region of space. The local warlord values his position as the policeman of southern Dvaered space, and makes sure his rivals are aware of his power. The result is a lot of low-key but nonetheless obvious infighting between the rival warlords. Dvaered High Command tolerates such antics as it keeps a large number of troops in the region on hand.</description>
  <bar>The bar is more of a military canteen that reluctantly allows civilians. The inhabitants are soldiers who are served the typical freeze-dried, prepackaged and sub-par food and drink.</bar>
