  <description>Though Gorchenchev Shipyards is a commercial enterprise, House Sirius has licensed it to produce their military ships. As such, the station is classified as a military installation, meaning no access to independent traders.</description>
  <bar>The factional emblem of House Sirius is predominant in this spacedock bar. The owner of the station clearly wants to show that his allegiance to his faction is strong.</bar>
