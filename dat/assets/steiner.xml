  <description>Once a highly prosperous planet of the Old Empire, Uhrabi-9 was tragically struck by a large asteroid, causing large amounts of volcanic activity and reducing the planet to a lifeless state. Steiner, one of the satellites previously used by the people of Uhrabi-9, is now a popular tourist spot due to its proximity to it.</description>
