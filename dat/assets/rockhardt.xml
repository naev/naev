  <description>Rockhardt was originally commissioned as an auxiliary manufacturing plant for the Imperial military. But when the Incident happened the Empire lost a lot of its core manufacturing plants, and Rockhardt was upgraded to a main line facility. An observant visitor can clearly make out the boundary between the first and second generation industrial centers.</description>
  <bar>Even today, the Empire's military remains a well oiled machine. It isn't content to work with old or substandard equipment, and so replacement parts and ships must constantly be produced. Rockhardt has a steady supply of manufacturing orders coming in at any given time, and the commercial traffic that accompanies it is clearly visible in the spaceport bar.</bar>
