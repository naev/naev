  <description>A formerly-promising world; following intense volcanic activity, Hurada's orbit decayed, increasing surface temperatures severely and all but eradicating natural surface life. Hurada only maintains a population due to its proximity to Arcturus, providing affordable housing for reserve military troops.</description>
  <bar>The Hurada bar is large, yet nearly deserted. The booth seats in the back have long been unused, and have collected a layer of dust in that time. The brews are stale, and the bartender doesn't look like he wants to be here.</bar>
