  <description>Once an independent world, home to pirates and black market traders, Arch Arai has long since fallen under the spell of the Touched. Now it is a fairly law-abiding Sirius world, earning its existence through trade and industry like almost every other planet.</description>
  <bar>This bar is a quiet place. Though it is certainly not lacking in patronage, the people who come here don't seem about to make a fuss over anything. The effect is contagious making newcomers follow the example of those who are already there, almost instinctively.</bar>
