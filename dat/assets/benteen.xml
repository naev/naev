  <description>Benteen is one of the Empire's primary agriworlds. It grows most of the crops that are bound for the western systems. It is a quiet world, with little in the way of the bustle and fuss of other, more core, planets.</description>
  <bar>The bar is a place to relax after a long trip or a hard day's work. The beer is fine and the locals seem friendly enough. Mostly harmless.</bar>
