  <description>It is said that when the first colonist ship landed here, its captain took a look outside and muttered to himself: "what a ruin of a planet". His cabin crew overheard, and the word stuck. Today, the planet is officially known as Ruin on all publicly sold star maps.</description>
  <bar>Ruin's spaceport bar is a deliberate retro affair. Although it does have all of the standard spaceport facilities, they have been encased in old-fashioned terminal housings. The furniture and overall design also have been styled on what was commonplace several dozen cycles ago. Some like it, some don't.</bar>
