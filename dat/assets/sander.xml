  <description>Griffin III's sister world is Kramer. Much of the surface is water, so it has a significantly lower population than it's compatriot. However, those same oceans provide a lot of food and rare compounds for the Empire's consumption. Perhaps not as rich as Griffin III, but quite close.</description>
  <bar>This underwater bar is quite the spectacle Large marine creatures swim by the windows, and the main lobby is designed to enhance the aesthetic. A little overdone, but it is nice overall.</bar>
