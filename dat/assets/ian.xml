  <description>Serving as the main consumer world on the Western fringe of Empire space, Ian makes up for its small size by its wealth. The little sphere is quite a pleasant place to live and many retiring Imperial officials and aristocrats have made the place their home. And where wealth goes, industry follows - Ian has its own modest ship construction facilities.</description>
  <bar>On Ian, it's all about being seen. The bar never goes quiet, though the level of noise also never grows to uncivilized proportions. Both the gentry and the rich up-starts come to the recreational facilities to mingle and to strut their stuff to the offworlders who come here on business.</bar>
