  <description>Crylo is an oceanic world with very little land surface, but it sports a surprising number of inhabitants. As it happens, the aquatic life found on this world is considered a delicacy in large parts of the galaxy, which has both attracted people to settle on the planet and spawned a flourishing fishing industry.</description>
  <bar>Fishing is the name of the game on Crylo, and the spaceport bar is nothing if not in character. Almost everything in here is fish-themed, including the bar, which has been made out of the spine of some gargantuan aquatic creature.</bar>
