  <description>Lanze is one of the best developed colonies in the stellar neighbourhood. As such it is seen by many as the unofficial capital of the cluster of systems Margarita is part of. Many corporations have their branch headquarters here, and there is a high concentration of bureaucratic infrastructure present.</description>
  <bar>Where other spaceports tend to tuck their spaceport bars away in a corner of the spaceport facility, the architect of this spaceport decided the bar should be right on top of the complex - literally. The spaceport bar is the topmost facility, looking out and down on the rest of the spaceport. All outer walls and the ceiling are transparent, so visitors have a great view of spaceships coming in and going out.</bar>
