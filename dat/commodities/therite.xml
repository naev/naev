 <name>Therite</name>
 <description>Therite is an extremely rare compound that is mainly formed by extreme radiation. Although there are multiple theories, the dominant one speculates that it is a quasi-matter projection of self-interfering radiation. However, even without understanding the exact physics behind it, engineers have found a wide range of high-end materials applications for it, from sub-space sensors to reinforced armours, leading to a constant high demand for it.</description>
