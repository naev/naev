 <name>Space Moss</name>
 <description>It's not entirely clear how a moss can subsist without an atmosphere growing on asteroids, however, speculations point at a mixture of chemosynthesis, radiosynthesis, and photosynthesis. Some research also points at feral bioships tending to the moss, but that has not been established as a standard behaviour, and is limited to a few anecdotes.</description>
