 <name>Nebula Crystals</name>
 <description>It is not clear exactly how these crystals are formed, but they can be found in the depths of the nebula. They feel oddly warm to the touch and sometimes you think you can hear noises coming from them. Your scanners, however, don't show anything out of the ordinary.</description>
