At night, human beings raise their eyes to heaven. They look up with a question, or in fear, or sometimes with an ambition to venture forth among the stars.

From Earth, the first space-farers discovered tiny jewels shining with the light of distant suns, far away but so clear. To reach out and grasp them would only cost a lifetime. Cheap at the price.

So men and women locked their bodies into hulking metal boxes. They hurled themselves out into the void. On their arrival, they decanted their sleeping bodies and woke to find new stars staring coldly down from stranger skies.

At first explorers crept from star to star, held back by the speed of light. Then, the invention of the hyperspace drive spurred a second growth, and civilisation spread, as it always has, with exponential enthusiasm -- ripples in the water.

However, the new age of discovery lasted only as long as curiosity outpaced greed. Too soon, conflict erupted between settlers on the colonies. Land, fuel, food, and distrust sowed the seeds of discord. Once begun, it spread from world to world in a terrific conflagration.

On the ashes of a hundred years of interstellar war, at last a new order built foundations.

A man named Daedris asserted dominion over the exhausted worlds. He founded a cosmic Empire and named himself its ruler. Under the iron fist of his military, relations between planets resumed, abandoned trade routes saw traffic for the first time in living memory.

Scholars call it the zenith: technology leapt forward, culture flourished, irradiated rock was cleansed and dead planets brought back to life. Peace reigned in an imperial golden age.

After Daedris, his successors oversaw a slow collapse. Squabbling classes and religious factions weakened social bonds. The great projects of the imperium went awry and administration fell into the hands of other powers. The Houses now policed the space lanes. Rise and fall, the rhythm of history. 

But the Incident broke history. It tore the heart out of the Empire.

From Earth, a cataclysmic explosion ripped through space, annihilating stars, vaporising worlds. Dozens of systems disappeared into a mysterious nebula. Now the great, galaxy-spanning civilisation survives as a shadow of its former glory.

What else remains? Questions.

Ten SCU have passed. You take command of your ship in a universe ruled by the shard of a decaying Empire. After the Incident, corruption and piracy run rampant. But where there is chaos, there is also opportunity.

Welcome to the universe of Naev...
