   text[8]  = [["You can fire your primary weapon with %s, and your secondary weapon with %s. Don't forget that some weapons won't work properly unless you target the ship first, and some homing missile weapons require you to face your target until you get a lock."]]

   text[9]  = [["Pressing %s will bring up the overlay map. This map shows everything you know about in the current system. You can right-click anywhere on this map to engage Autonav, which will automatically fly you to that location."]]

   text[10] = [["Pressing %s will bring up the star map, where you can look at the systems you know about. From here, you can also use Autonav to easily and quickly travel between systems."]]

   text[11] = [["Pressing %s will bring up the small menu, where you can quit the game or access the options menu."]]

   text[12] = [["And finally, pressing %s will bring up your information screen, where you can view your stats and missions."]]

   text[13] = [["Well, that's pretty much it! There are more controls, but they aren't really essential. You can review them later on in the Options menu if you want to. If you want a more in-depth overview, you can go through the tutorials from the main menu. Good luck, %s!" And with that, you set off on your journey.]]
