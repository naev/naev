   Pirate Fame/Faction Standing script

   When the player enters a system, his fame has a chance of being lowered.

   If he is using a pirate ship, the chances of his fame being lowered are
   reduced. If the player is using an impressive non-pirate ship, like the
   cruiser or carrier of a major faction, will lower a bit less often, but
   will lower more often than if he was using a purely pirate ship.

   This event will not reduce the player’s fame below a given level.
