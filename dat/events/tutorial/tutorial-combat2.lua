    title1 = "Tutorial: Missile Combat"
    message1 = [[Welcome to the missile combat tutorial.

Guided missile weapons behave differently from other weapons. This tutorial explains the basic mechanics and teaches you how to handle such weapons.]]
    message2 = [[You are currently equipped with a Unicorp Fury Launcher. Fury missiles are low-end interceptor missiles that excel at chasing down agile targets such as light fighters.

In order to fire your missile weapon, you must first target the ship you want to shoot at, and then keep the target within an arc in front of your ship. The easiest way to do this is by holding down the auto-face button (%s). While the target is in the lockon arc, your missile weapon will gradually establish a lock. Until this process is complete, you cannot fire the weapon.

Try this now on the mobile drone in your vicinity.]]
    message3 = [[Well done. While the weapon locked on, you may have noticed an indicator on your HUD showing you the lock-on progress. This indicator exists for all weapon systems that require a lock before firing. Note that the time it takes for the lock to be established depends on several factors, including the stealth rating of the target and how good the weapon is at locking on. The lock will also degrade if your target is not within the lockon arc, even if it has been fully established. If you lose the lock, you will have to get another lock before you can fire.

You may fire your missiles now. Note that missile launchers are treated as secondary weapons by default, so you should use the secondary fire button (%s) to fire them. Of course, you can modify this using the weapon groups.

Destroy the target drone.]]
    message4 = [[Very good. Of course, this was just a target drone. A mobile target will give you a better idea of how missiles behave in real combat. Fortunately, we have an excellent pilot on hand who can help out there. He assured us that reports of his recent obliteration in another tutorial were highly exaggerated, and we trust him implicitly on that.

You have been given two fully loaded Unicorp Fury Launchers. Engage Captain T. Practice with them. Notice how the missiles will actively seek out the target. It's possible to avoid guided missiles, even the fast Fury missiles, but it's not easy to do.]]
    message5 = [[Hmm, that was over quick. Oh well. You should now have a solid grasp on how to use missile weapons. As a final tip, turreted missile launchers have a full 360 degree lockon arc, so all you have to do to acquire a lock is target an enemy.

Congratulations! This concludes the missile combat tutorial.]]
