time_dilation_text = _([[The person who sells you the %s looks at your record and pauses. "Ah, I see you haven't owned a large ship before! Sorry to slow you down, but I just wanted to tell you some important things about your ship. I promise I'll be but a moment.
    "Firstly, you may notice that the ship you bought has a 'Time Dilation' rating. See, when operating a larger ship, you have to expend more time and effort performing the basic operations of the ship, causing your perception of time to speed up. Time Dilation is simply a measure of how fast you will perceive the passage of time compared to a typical small ship; for example, a Time Dilation rating of 200%% means that time appears to pass twice as fast as typical small ships.
    "This, and the slower speed of your ship, may make it difficult to use forward-facing weapons as well as on smaller ships. For the largest classes - Destroyers and up - I would generally recommend use of turreted weapons, which will automatically aim at your opponent, rather than forward-facing weapons. That's of course up to you, though.
    "That's all! Sorry to be a bother. I wish you good luck in your travels!" You thank the salesperson and continue on your way.]])
