    message1 = [[Welcome to the activated outfits tutorial.

This tutorial explains how activated outfits differ from regular ones, and how to use them.]]
   message2 = [[Let's begin with some theory. In general, there exist three types of outfits: passive outfits, activated outfits and weapons. Weapons are covered in another tutorial. Let's examine passive and activated outfits here.

Passive outfits modify your ship some way, and are always in effect. Engine Reroutes, Generators, Armor and Fuel Pods are examples of passive outfits.

Activated outfits have three possible states they can be in: off, on and cooldown. While off or in cooldown, the outfit does nothing for you. It only weighs down your ship. When on, its effects are applied to your ship, and it will consume whatever resources it demands from your ship.]]
   message3 = [[In this tutorial, your ship has been equipped with a single Unicorp Jammer. This is an activated outfit that can help you evade incoming missiles, but only when it's active.

The Jammer has automatically been assigned to a group, and can be activated by pressing %s.

Activated outfits can also be manually assigned to groups, just like weapons. To do so, open the information menu using %s, select a group you want to use for the outfit, then click on the outfit in the slots diagram. The group will switch from a weapon group to an activated outfit group automatically.

Once this is done, you can use the hotkey associated with the group (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s or %s) to turn the outfit on and off.

Try activating your Jammer now. Keep an eye on your energy reserves when it is active.]]
   message4 = [[As you can see, the Jammer drains your energy while it is on. Since you will need your energy for other things, it's a good idea to only activate it when you need it.

It is important to know that some activated outfits can remain on as long as you have the energy, while others will only stay on for a maximum amount of time. Also, some outfits will need to go through a cooldown period after shutting off, during which time you can't use them. When an outfit is in its cooldown period, you can look at its icon to see how far along it is.

Some outfits may also lose effectiveness or shut off completely if they get hot.]]

   message5 = [[You now know how to assign an activated outfit to a group and how to turn it on. As a final tip, remember that you can assign as many activated outfits to the same group as you like. You can combine outfit effects this way.

Congratulations! This concludes the activated outfits tutorial.]]
