--[[
I lost my friend and fam’ly to a pirate raid
The captain stood before me, I thought meself for dead
Instead he told me rise up, come to the endless sea
Into the black I followed, a pirate’s life for me.

Yo ho yo ho a pirate life for me
In endless black we gonna attack
A pirate’s life for me

Yo ho yo ho, up in the endless sea
I may be hanged, don’t give a damn
A pirate’s life for me

The empire sent their warships, to capture our fair crew
A thousand ships before us, and surely we were screwed
The captain said “Me hearties! At last we sail to hell!”
My life was maybe short, but I’m sure I’ve spent it well

Yo ho yo ho go down on your knee
Man the guns and hit them hard
A pirate’s death for me

Yo ho yo ho life with sword and gun
May get you wealth, just fly in stealth
But sure you won’t see home
