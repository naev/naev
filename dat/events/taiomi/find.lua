Although my peers will likely make fun of me if they find out, I have decided to start a paper log of my upcoming travels aboard the Beagle. It was hard to find a place selling paper notebooks, as everyone uses holopads, but I was able to find a small place at an antique shop on Antica. For such primitive technology, it was very expensive.

I look forward to starting my travels next decaperiod! It will be my first time leaving Arcturus in ages!]]))
   log(_([[UST 602:1928

I have met the crew. They seem fairly friendly except for the big silent guy. I wonder if it will all work out… I just have to stop messing things up this time.

My room is a bit small, but as expected. My roommate seems like a quiet person. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get used to all this floating around in zero-gravity though.]]))
   log(_([[UST 602:1971

We are on route to the Delta Pavonis system.

Things haven't been working too well. There was a leak in one of the radiators. We almost got fried, but my roommate was able to fix it in time.]]))
   log(_([[UST 602:1980

The Captain got in a fight with the provider that was supposed to give us the cargo to take to the Qex system… I don't know what we'll do if this trip gets cancelled… It will look horrible on my Curriculum Vitae…]]))
   log(_([[UST 602:1983

It seems like we got another commission, but we have to go to some place called Hatter in Soromid space… The navigator claims he knows a shortcut, but I have a bad feeling about this.

I want to run back home, but I can't quit so early. They would never stop making fun of me. Maybe Soromid space will be interesting?

We leave to Dune next period.]]))
   log(_([[UST 602:1995

We have made it to Arrakis in the Dune system.

The sand is awful here. It gets in everything and everywhere, so I decided to cut short my visit of the local area. It's also nice to be in the ship alone. Much quieter and more peaceful.]]))

   log(_([[UST 602:1999

We have finished loading the cargo, which consists of some sort of bottles of something like sand? The Captain said it is very expensive and was yelling at us all the time while we were loading the cargo.

I have decided that once this is over I will try to find a new job. I don't think I will ever get used to the Captain's temper.

Since it seems like the navigator has a bit of a hangover, we leave in 5 periods.]]))
   log(_([[UST 602:2008

It was very hard to wake the navigator and we are behind schedule again. I hate getting yelled at.

We are on on our way to Soromid space, but I don't think the navigator is in much condition to fly.]]))

We are being shot at! There's pirates all over! This is not what I signed up for!

   log(_([[UST 602.2020

This is awful! We are hiding out in an asteroid field. Our cockpit was blown out and the navigator and captain are dead.

I have no idea what to do. It is very hard to write in my space suit, but I don't think the atmosphere unit is going to last long.]]))
   log(_([[UST (the date is blank)

Something is scratching at the hull. It sounds like a weird animal. I haven't seen any living person in I don't know how long.

There is no atmosphere and I can't take off my suit anymore. I don't see any way out.]]))
   log(_([[UST (the date is blank)

I have lost all notion of time.

They are all around. I don't really understand what they are. They look like small ships, but they are slowly and mechanically tearing apart the ship.

I'm going to die aren't I?]]))
   log(_([[UST (the date is blank)

I'm getting cold. I think the heating unit is malfunctioning.

I may have finally lost my mind. There are weird ships prying and removing the ship components. They seem to behave like some sort of pack of wild animals.]]))

I don't feel hunger anymore. The numbness sensation is spreading.

The ships don't seem to pay me much attention as they come and go. They remind me of ants back home.]]))

(There are lots of weird scribbles on the page, however, you can make some sort of map with an area indicated by a big X. It seems like you could investigate this.)
