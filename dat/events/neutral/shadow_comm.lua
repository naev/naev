She wishes to meet with you at a place of her choosing, and a time of yours. It involves a proposition that you might find interesting - if you don't mind sticking your neck out."
    You frown at that, but you ask the pilot where this acquaintance wishes you to go anyway.
    "Fly to the %s system," he replies. "She will meet you there. There's no rush, but I suggest you go see her at the earliest opportunity."
    The screen blinks out and the Vendetta goes about its business, paying you no more attention. It seems there's someone out there who wants to see you, and there's only one way to find out what about. Perhaps you should make a note of the place you're supposed to meet her: the %s system.]])

    "As was mentioned previously, the one sho wishes to meet you can be found in the %s system, which is near Empire space. Again, there's no rush, but I suggest you go to see her at the earliest opportunity."
    The screen blinks out and the Vendetta goes about its business, paying you no more attention. You make a mental note again to try to remember to go to the %s system when you get the chance.]])
