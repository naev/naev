      Ideas
   * Vampiric weapon that removes shield regen, but regenerates shield by doing damage.
   * Hot-dog launcher (for sale after Reynir mission): does no damage, but has decent knockback and unique effect
   * Money launcher: does fairly good damage, but runs mainly on credits instead of energy
   * Mask of many faces: outfit that changes bonuses based on the dominant faction of the system you are in (needs event to handle changing outfit)
   * Weapon that does double damage to the user if misses
   * Weapon that damages the user each time it is shot (some percent only)
   * Space mines! AOE damage that affects everyone, but they don't move (useful for missions too!)
