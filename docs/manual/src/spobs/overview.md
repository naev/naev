# Space Objects (Spobs)

You can either create spobs manually by copying and pasting existing spobs and editing them (make sure to add them to a system!), or create and manipulate them with the in-game editor accessible from the "Extras" button in the main menu.
Note that the in-game editor doesn't support all the complex functionality, but does a large part of the job such as choosing graphics and positioning the spobs.
