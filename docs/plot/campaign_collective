   OVERVIEW 

      Short campaign, mainly to use as an introduction to naev and for the
   first release.


   HISTORY

      The Collective are a recently new menace.  They caught the empire off
   guard and took over a few system which they proceded to systematically
   purge of all life forms.  The Empire then responded to the attack and a
   stalemate was reached.  Frequent skirmishes still occuring around the
   border star systems.
      A lot of speculation has been created among the Collective.  Top secret
   scientific gone wrong?  New weapon of the FLF?  Long-existing civilization
   converted to robots?  No one knows for certain.
