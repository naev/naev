"Passive outfits modify your ship some way, and are always in effect. Engine "
"Reroutes, Generators, Armor and Fuel Pods are examples of passive outfits.\n"
"\n"
"Activated outfits have three possible states they can be in: off, on and "
"cooldown. While off or in cooldown, the outfit does nothing for you. It only "
"weighs down your ship. When on, its effects are applied to your ship, and it "
"will consume whatever resources it demands from your ship."

"In this tutorial, your ship has been equipped with a single Unicorp Jammer. "
"This is an activated outfit that can help you evade incoming missiles, but "
"only when it's active.\n"

"The Jammer has automatically been assigned to a group, and can be activated "
"by pressing %s.\n"

"Activated outfits can also be manually assigned to groups, just like "
"weapons. To do so, open the information menu using %s, select a group you "

"%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s or %s) to turn the outfit on and off.\n"

"is active."
msgstr ""

"As you can see, the Jammer drains your energy while it is on. Since you will "
"need your energy for other things, it's a good idea to only activate it when "
"you need it.\n"
"\n"
"It is important to know that some activated outfits can remain on as long as "
"you have the energy, while others will only stay on for a maximum amount of "
"time. Also, some outfits will need to go through a cooldown period after "
"shutting off, during which time you can't use them. When an outfit is in its "
"cooldown period, you can look at its icon to see how far along it is.\n"

"hot."

"As you can see, having a hot ship is very inconvenient. It would be nice if "
"ships could lose their heat somehow, wouldn't it? Fortunately, there are "
"some ways to lose heat.\n"
"\n"
"First of all, ships radiate off heat if they are hotter than the space "
"around them. This happens automatically and continuously, but it is a "
"relatively slow process, especially for larger ships. It may be possible to "
"accelerate the rate of heat loss by installing outfits to that effect.\n"
"\n"
"Heat is also reset to the base level when you land. So every time you take "
"off, you will start out with a nice, cool hull.\n"
"\n"

"Every ship has the ability to go into a special cooling mode called Active "
"Cooldown. When in Active Cooldown, ships rapidly lose their heat. By the end "
"of the cooldown cycle, the ship and all its outfits will have cooled to the "
"galactic base temperature.\n"
"\n"
"Let's try this now. If you're moving, press %s to begin braking, and then "
"press it again to enter Active Cooldown mode. When not moving, pressing %s "
"will immediately enter Active Cooldown mode."
msgstr ""

"You are now in Active Cooldown mode. You will see a progress bar above your "
"ship. It is slowly draining. When the bar is completely empty, your ship "
"will have cooled down. Don't touch any of the controls, or Active Cooldown "
"will be canceled and you will have to restart it.\n"
"\n"
"While you are in active cooldown, your energy and shields will not recharge. "
"So try to use it only in a safe spot.\n"

"Well done! You have completed the Active Cooldown cycle, and your ship is as "
"cool as the space around it.\n"
"\n"
"As you might have noticed during the cooldown process, your heat didn't drop "
"very quickly until the cooling process was almost over. This is because heat "
"is lost at an exponential rate in Active Cooldown mode. It starts off very "
"slow, but picks up a lot of speed over time. What this means is that when "
"using Active Cooldown, you're going to want to wait all the way until the "
"end. Active Cooldown always takes a minimum amount of time, and if you abort "
"the cooldown period, you have to start over from the beginning next time!\n"
"\n"
"Another important thing to remember is that Active Cooldown only works if "
"the ship is sitting still. You can't do it on the move! So while it might "
"seem attractive to use Active Cooldown in a fight to cool your weapons, you "
"make yourself very vulnerable by doing so."
