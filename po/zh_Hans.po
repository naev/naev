"From Earth, the first space-farers spied tiny jewels shining with the light "
"of distant suns, far away but so clear. To reach out and grasp one would "
"only cost a lifetime. Cheap at the price."

msgid ""
"So men and women locked their sleeping bodies into hulking metal boxes. They "
"hurled themselves out into the void. On arrival, they decanted and woke to "

msgid ""
"The first wave of explorers crept from star to star at sublight speeds, "
"until the invention of the hyperspace drive spurred a second growth. Then "
"civilisation spread, as it always has, with exponential enthusiasm -- "
"ripples in the dark sea of space."
msgstr ""

#: dat/intro:12
msgid ""
"However, the heroic age of discovery lasted only as long as human curiosity "
"outpaced greed. Too soon, conflict erupted on the colonies. Land, fuel, "
"food, and distrust sowed the seeds of discord. Once begun, the fever of war "
"spread from world to world and became a holocaust."

"A man named Daedris asserted dominion over the exhausted worlds. He founded "
"a Galactic Empire and named himself its ruler. Under the iron fist of his "
"military, relations between planets resumed; abandoned trade routes saw "
"traffic for the first time in living memory."
msgstr ""

#: dat/intro:19
msgid ""
"Scholars call it the zenith: technology leapt forward, culture flourished, "
"irradiated rock was cleansed and dead planets brought back to life. Peace "
"reigned in an imperial golden age."
msgstr ""

#: dat/intro:21
msgid ""
"After Daedris, under his successors, the light of the empire waned. Civil "
"strife and religious division weakened social bonds. The great projects of "
"the imperium went awry. In some regions, administration fell into the hands "
"of other powers. The Great Houses now policed the space lanes."

"From Earth, a cataclysmic explosion ripped through space, annihilating "

"Wunomi's World is an old world that was colonized early for its similarity "
"with the now-gone Earth. However, unlike Earth, the governor wanted to keep "
"the planet in a less developed state, conserving much of its natural fauna "
"and beauty. Development was then taken to space, in which an enormous "
"geostationary ring was built, known as Wunomi's Ring. Only few cities remain "
"down on the surface, with much of the focus on managing tourism. Most of the "
"population lives in the ring which has gotten slightly crowded with the "
"Incident. However, Wunomi's World acts as an important local trade hub, and "
"work is still plentiful due to a somewhat strict population control system "
"designed to conserve the planet and by extension ring's characteristic "
"nature.\n"
"As most of the population and cities are located on the ring instead of the "
"planet, it is closer to a station than a planet. Low gravity allows for easy "
"transpiration of bulk goods and encourages the sale of ships. For this "
"reason, it is easy to find many supplies tailored for traders."

"sofas are suspended throughout, making it look like almost some boats "
"floating at sea. Although confusing first, when you get used to it you begin "

"Fortunately, our top strategists have come up with a ruse, one that will "
"make the FLF come to us.\"\n"
"   \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" "
"Urnus continues. The image on the wall zooms up to the {sys} system, and a "
"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them. It is important to note that the transponder will "
"work best in the Nebula, which we believe is where the base should be "
"located.\"\n"
"   The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"   \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "
"has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtedly "
"send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""

"ship's computer and download the flight log, which should contain the "
"location of the FLF base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your "
"mission will be complete.\"\n"
"   The image on the wall updates one last time, simulating the battle as "
"described by Colonel Urnus. Several FLF logos appear, which are promptly "
"surrounded by the Dvaered ones. Then the logos turn gray, indicating that "
"they've been disabled.\n"
"   \"Let me make one thing clear, citizen. You are allowed, even expected, "

"it look you're on the losing side, or the FLF will not come to your aid! So, "
"do NOT disable or destroy any Dvaered ships, and make sure your own armour "
"takes a bit of a beating. This is vital to the success of the mission. Do "
"not fail.\"\n"
"   Colonel Urnus seems to have concluded his explanation, so you, having "
"spotted the obvious flaw in the Dvaereds' plan, pop the question of what "

#. -- This is the 5th mission of the Frontier War Dvaered campaign.
#. -- The player has to secure a Dvaered Warlord Meeting.
#. -- Hamelsen lures out the player, while Strafer gets killed by a spy who runs away.
#. -- There are two parts in the mission : part 1 is mainly contemplative, and part 2 is tricky, with fights and so.
#.
#. Stages :
#. 0) Way to Dvaer Prime
#. 1) Briefing at Dvaer Prime and patrol around DHC
#. 2) Following Hamelsen towards Laars (main purpose of this is to let the player save the game because second part is tricky)
#. 3) Taking off from Laars
#. 4) Land on Laars and get rewarded

"\"Both squadrons of the DHC station's space security force will be deployed "
"with a full range ships from Vendettas to Goddards. Those squadrons are the "
"'Beta-Storks' and the 'Beta-Hammer' and their mission will be to control "
"medium and heavy ships and to provide heavy firepower in case of need. Our "
"squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and "
"Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.\n"
"   \"The plan is the following: any ship approaching the station will be "
"assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad "
"leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is assigned to you, you will have to "
"approach the ship within 1000 km. Their security clearance code will be "
"automatically requested and processed by the system we'll install in your "
"core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to fly "
"away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.\n"
"   \"Finally, in case something unexpected happens, you will, of course, "
"have to obey orders. Watch your messages closely. A few pilots will be kept "
"in reserve close to the station.\n"
"   \"Oh, and there is another thing I must warn you about: it's the "
"warlord's odd sense of humour. When they see a small ship close to their "
"Goddard, they may get the idea to shoot a small railgun-volley in your "
"direction. Some of them tend to enjoy seeing pilots fend for their lives. "

#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defence force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.

#. DESCRIPTION: An old man who owns a hot dog factory wants to go to space
#.
#. The old man has elevated pressure in his cochlea so he can't go to space.
#. He's getting old and wants to go to space before he dies. He owns a hot dog
#. factory and will pay you in hot dogs (food). Because of his illness, you
#. can't land on any planet outside the system (the player doesn't know this).
#.
#. NOTE: This mission is best suited in systems with 2 or more planets, but can
#. be used in any system with a planet.

#. Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
#. How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
#. So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
#. I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?

#. * They are run in a shared state. All global variables will be the same for all outfits of the same type.
#. * You can use the 'mem' table to access memory for the particular outfit being used.
#. * You have access to the pilotoutfit API which is meant for manipulating po.
#. * Use the <desc_extra> field in the XML when describing what the Lua does.

#. The onload is run once when the outfit Lua is loaded. Useful for setting up
#. variables. The passed variable is the outfit itself.

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets more complex. An outfit pool is created, consisting of
#. the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. In parallel, if the player can't modify their fleet and are over fleet
#. capacity, they are also considered stranded.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
#. Generate a deduplicated list.
#. Iterate to find outfits matching the size and property of the empty
#. core outfit slots.
#. Nothing to fill the slots could be found.
#. Builds the tables of required, equipped, and missing outfits.
#. Clear tables.
#. Find the number of required cores, and their default outfits.
#. Find equipped cores.

#. A module containing a diversity of Love2D shaders for use in Naev. These are
#. designed to be used with the different aspects of the VN framework.
#.
#. In general all shaders have a "strength" parameter indicating the strength
#. of the effect. Furthermore, those that have a temporal component have a
#. "speed" parameter. These are all normalized such that 1 is the default
#. value. Temporal component can also be inverted by setting a negative value.

#. @tfield number speed Speed of the effect normalized such that 1.0 is the default value. Negative values run the effect backwards. Only used for those shaders with temporal components.
#. @tfield Colour colour Colour component to be used. Should be in the form of {r, g, b} where r, g, and b are numbers.
#. @tfield number size Affects the size of the effect.
