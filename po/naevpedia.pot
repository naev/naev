#: dat/naevpedia/mechanics/time.md:10
msgid "UST consists of three basic components describing different amounts of time: the second, which is equivalent to an Earth second; the period, which is equal to 10,000 seconds; and the cycle, which is equal to 5,000 periods (50,000,000 seconds). In colloquial usage, the terms \"decaperiod\" (equivalent to 10 periods) and \"hectosecond\" (equivalent to 100 seconds) are also common. UST dates are written in the form:"

#: dat/naevpedia/mechanics/time.md:18
msgid "When describing lengths of time, it is commonplace for computer systems to indicate a number of periods with a lowercase \"p\" or a number of seconds with a lowercase \"s\". This convention is not used for cycles, which are always spelled out in full as \"cycles\". This convention is also not adopted in spoken form since it's more natural to just say \"periods\" and \"seconds\" rather than a single-letter abbreviation. Additionally, due to the metric nature of the time system, periods and seconds can be written out as a single unit, although in spoken conversation people report the periods and cycles separately. Some examples:"
