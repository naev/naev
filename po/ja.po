"Heat is generated by outfits, particularly weapons. Each time you fire a "
"weapon, some of the energy needed to fire it will be converted into heat. "
"This heat accumulates in the weapon outfit, and if the outfit gets hotter "
"and hotter, it starts to lose its efficiency. For weapons, this means that "
"they become inaccurate when they get hot, and start firing more slowly when "
"very hot.\n"
"\n"
"You have been equipped with two Vulcan Cannons. To see how heat builds up in "

"As you probably saw, your weapons started shooting slightly off to the sides "

"\n"
"When weapons get hot, they will automatically cool because the heat flows "
"from the outfits into the ship hull. So, it can be a good idea to not use "
"all of your weapons at the same time if you expect a long fight. Switch "
"between weapons to let them cool down periodically."

"So that's heat in a nutshell, right? As it turns out, there's more to it. We "
"just learned that weapons cool down by transferring heat into the ship hull. "
"But what if the ship hull gets hot?\n"
"\n"
"One thing that happens is that the ship becomes more visible to enemies. "
"Objects that are hotter than the space around them will stand out more. So "
"if your ship is hot, you might attract more attention.\n"
"\n"
"Another thing that happens is that your outfits, which are connected to the "
"hull, start to cool more slowly! After all, heat transfer depends heavily on "
"the difference in temperature between objects. So, if your ship gets very "
"hot, you may find that your weapons don't cool as fast anymore, or not at "
"all in extreme cases.\n"
"\n"
"For the purpose of this tutorial, we have made your ship rather hot. Notice "
"the ship temperature indicator on the HUD, and notice also how your weapons "
"aren't cooling anymore."

"As you can see, having a hot ship is very inconvenient. It would be nice if "
"ships could lose their heat somehow, wouldn't it? Fortunately, there are "
"some ways to lose heat.\n"
"\n"
"First of all, ships radiate off heat if they are hotter than the space "
"around them. This happens automatically and continuously, but it is a "
"relatively slow process, especially for larger ships. It may be possible to "
"accelerate the rate of heat loss by installing outfits to that effect.\n"
"\n"
"Heat is also reset to the base level when you land. So every time you take "
"off, you will start out with a nice, cool hull.\n"

"There is a third way to lose heat, however."

"Every ship has the ability to go into a special cooling mode called Active "
"Cooldown. When in Active Cooldown, ships rapidly lose their heat. By the end "
"of the cooldown cycle, the ship and all its outfits will have cooled to the "
"galactic base temperature.\n"
"\n"
"Let's try this now. If you're moving, press %s to begin braking, and then "
"press it again to enter Active Cooldown mode. When not moving, pressing %s "
"will immediately enter Active Cooldown mode."

"will be canceled and you will have to restart it.\n"
"\n"
"While you are in active cooldown, your energy and shields will not recharge. "

"Well done! You have completed the Active Cooldown cycle, and your ship is as "
"cool as the space around it.\n"
"\n"
"As you might have noticed during the cooldown process, your heat didn't drop "
"very quickly until the cooling process was almost over. This is because heat "
"is lost at an exponential rate in Active Cooldown mode. It starts off very "
"slow, but picks up a lot of speed over time. What this means is that when "
"using Active Cooldown, you're going to want to wait all the way until the "
"end. Active Cooldown always takes a minimum amount of time, and if you abort "
"the cooldown period, you have to start over from the beginning next time!\n"
"\n"
"Another important thing to remember is that Active Cooldown only works if "
"the ship is sitting still. You can't do it on the move! So while it might "
"seem attractive to use Active Cooldown in a fight to cool your weapons, you "
"make yourself very vulnerable by doing so."

#. Drinking Aristocrat
#. Author: geekt
#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
#.
#.
#. This section stores the strings (text) for the mission.
#. Mission details
#. Create the mission on the current planet, and present the first Bar text.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system
#. hook warm reception to player landing
#. If player didn't accept the mission, the battle's still on, but player has no stake.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system when not part of defense
#. Decides what to do when player either takes off starting planet or jumps into another system
#. There's a battle to defend the system
#. Makes the system empty except for the two fleets. No help coming.
#. Set up distances
#. Create a fleet of raiding pirates
#. And a fleet of defending independents
#. How the Battle ends:
#. hook fleet departure to disabling or killing ships
#. Record each raider death and make the raiders flee after too many casualties
#. A few seconds after the raiders start to flee declare victory
#. Call ships back to base
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.
#. A fellow warrior says hello in passing if player jumps out of the system without landing
#.
#.
#. MISSION: Defend the System 2
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the second in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third mission, perhaps there'll be a regular diet of similar missions
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.

#. MISSION: Hot dogs from space
#. DESCRIPTION: An old man who owns a hot dog factory wants to go to space
#.
#. The old man has elevated pressure in his cochlea so he can't go to space.
#. He's getting old and wants to go to space before he dies. He owns a hot dog
#. factory and will pay you in hot dogs (food). Because of his illness, you
#. can't land on any planet outside the system (the player doesn't know this).
#.
#. NOTE: This mission is best suited in systems with 2 or more planets, but can
#. be used in any system with a planet.

#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:

#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or sructure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent

#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.

#. combat. mmmm.
#. Includes the player as an enemy to be iterated over.
#. Iterate over enemies to see if at least one is in range.
#. The inrange variable was already defaulted to false.
#. If an enemy is in range, no need to continue looping.
#. We want to seperate out the for loop that finds enemies and the if functions that control combat, so that all of the enemy pilots are iterated over to see if one is in range before controlling the pilots.
#. It's also easier on my brain. </lazy>
#. If baddies are in range and the fleet isn't set to do combat yet, then...
#. ...cut 'em loose.
#. No need to iterate further. No need to do the rest of this function either!
#. If baddies are in range, and the fleet was already in combat, no need to de-control them again. Prevents spam broadcasting.
#. If no badguys are in range...
#. ...and the fleet is no longer in combat, then...
#. ...flip the combat flag, and continue the function.
#. give the fleader his orders back
#. At this point we know we're not in combat (well, the leader isn't).
#. Assign the coordinates.
#. Remember, there is no need to check if a pilot exists, because we've already made sure all pilots exist.
#. Clear orders.
#. Computing the direction using a pd controller
#. Make mon capitan travel at 5 below the slow speed, so other ships can catch up.
#. Logic for fleet leader goes here. For now, let's allow the fleader to act according to the regular AI.
