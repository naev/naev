#. Victim isn't an ally. Attack the victim if the attacker is our ally.
#. If they're both enemies, may as well let them destroy each other.
#. We'll be nice and go after the aggressor if the victim is peaceful.
#. An aggressive, neutral ship is fighting another neutral ship. Who cares?
#. Non-aggressive ships will flee if their enemies attack neutral or allied vessels.

#. An extremely-hot weapon is a good reason to pick another set.
#. Puts the pilot into cooldown mode if its weapons are overly hot and its shields are relatively high.
#. This can happen during combat, so mem.heatthreshold should be quite high.
#. Don't want to cool down again so soon.
#. By default, 15 ticks will be 30 seconds.
#. The weapons are extremely hot and cooldown should be triggered.

"forward-facing weapons as well as on smaller ships. For the largest classes "

#. --    @param set table laying out the set of outfits to equip (see below).
#. --
#. -- ``set`` is split up into sub-tables that are iterated through. These
#. -- tables include a "num" field which indicates how many of the chosen outfit
#. -- to equip before moving on to the next set; if nil, the chosen outfit will be
#. -- equipped as many times as possible. For example, if you list 3 tables with
#. -- "num" set to 2, 1, and nil respectively, two of an outfit from the first
#. -- table will be equipped, followed by one of an outfit from the second table,
#. -- and then finally all remaining slots will be filled with an outfit from the
#. -- third table.
#. --
#. -- If, rather than equipping multiples of the same outfit you would like to
#. -- select a random outfit `num` times, you can do so by setting "varied" to
#. -- true.
#. --
#. -- "probability" can be set to a table specifying the relative chance of each
#. -- outfit (keyed by name) to the other outfits. If unspecified, each outfit
#. -- will have a relative chance of 1. So for example, if the outfits are "Foo",
#. -- "Bar", and "Baz", with no "probability" table, each outfit will have a 1/3
#. -- chance of being selected; however, with this "probability" table:
#. --
#. --    probability = { ["Foo"] = 6, ["Bar"] = 2 }
#. --
#. -- This will lead to "Foo" having a 6/9 (2/3) chance, "Bar" will have a 2/9
#. -- chance, and "Baz" will have a 1/9 chance
#. --
#. -- Note that there should only be one type of outfit (weapons, utilities, or
#. -- structurals) in ``set``; including multiple types will prevent proper
#. -- detection of how many are needed.

"\"Everyone,\" a stern-looking but otherwise nondescript Dvaered officer "
"addresses the room, \"If I may have your attention please. I am here to "
"brief you on the upcoming operation, which as you all know revolves around "
"the destruction of the terrorist base known as Sindbad.\"\n"
"    The wall behind the officer lights up, showing a schematic "
"representation of the %s system. In the middle sits a red glowing disc with "
"the FLF logo superimposed over it.\n"
"    \"We're dealing with a fully operational, heavily armed military "
"installation. The FLF may be terrorists, but they're well organized. Since "
"this is their biggest stronghold, we must assume this base is heavily armed, "
"and has a large complement of defensive spacecraft to defend it from attack. "
"We will therefore conduct our assault in two phases.\"\n"
"    The system schematic on the wall updates with a cluster of white Dvaered "
"logos, positioned some distance away from the glowing disc. There are also "
"several white dots which apparently represent the fighter escorts.\n"
"    \"Our strike force will consist out of the HDSF Obstinate, several "
"destroyer escorts and two wings of fighter escorts. In addition, our forces "
"will be joined by citizen %s, who has volunteered to fight on behalf of "
"House Dvaered on this occasion.\" The officer nods at you, then continues "
"his briefing. \"Our forces and formation will be such that it appears we are "
"preparing for a standard strafing run, and indeed this is what will happen "
"if the FLF decide to sit and cower. However, we expect them to put up a "
"fight.\""

"The schematic updates again, this time showing several small clusters of red "
"dots between the glowing disc and the Dvaered formation.\n"
"   \"The FLF will send out wings of fighters and bombers to engage our "
"strike force. At this time the number and composition of ships is unknown, "
"but it seems prudent to assume they will outnumber us by a fair margin. Your "
"task as auxiliary escorts is to protect the strike force's flanks and "
"intercept any FLF ships attempting to target the Obstinate. Be advised that "
"the Obstinate will have limited anti-fighter armaments available, as most of "
"its hull is dedicated to fighter bays. The Obstinate must not be destroyed! "
"This is your paradigm objective!\"\n"
"    On the wall, the red dots are intercepted by the white dots, and blink "
"out of existence. Then a second group of white dots appears near the Dvaered "
"logos, and moves towards the glowing disc.\n"
"    \"As soon as the FLF have exhausted their forces trying to "
"counterattack, the HDSF Obstinate will begin launching bombers. It is our "
"belief that the bombers alone will be able to take out the enemy base, but "
"in the event that resistance is heavier than expected, the Obstinate herself "
"will move in to provide fire support.\"\n"
"    The glowing disc on the wall fades out, leaving the Dvaered fleet alone "
"and victorious.\n"
"    \"That will be all. You have your orders. Report to your stations as per "
"your timetables. I will see you all in %s. Good luck.\"\n"
"    Some time later, you are back in the Dvaered spaceport bar. You've seen "
"action before in your career, but you still feel tense about what is to "
"come. You decide to have another drink, just for luck."

#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
#.
#.
#. This section stores the strings (text) for the mission.
#. Mission details
#. Create the mission on the current planet, and present the first Bar text.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system
#. hook warm reception to player landing
#. If player didn't accept the mission, the battle's still on, but player has no stake.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system when not part of defense
#. Decides what to do when player either takes off starting planet or jumps into another system
#. There's a battle to defend the system
#. Makes the system empty except for the two fleets. No help coming.
#. Set up distances
#. Create a fleet of raiding pirates
#. And a fleet of defending independents
#. How the Battle ends:
#. hook fleet departure to disabling or killing ships
#. Record each raider death and make the raiders flee after too many casualties
#. A few seconds after the raiders start to flee declare victory
#. Call ships back to base
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.
#. A fellow warrior says hello in passing if player jumps out of the system without landing
#.
#.
#. MISSION: Defend the System 2
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the second in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third mission, perhaps there'll be a regular diet of similar missions
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.

#. Oh yeah, we stole the ship. \o/
#. The old ship the player used will still be on the planet. I’m not
#. too sure what to do about it, but, well…
#. Two cannons should be enough for most not-so-big ships.
#. Hey, stealing a ship isn’t anything! (if you survive, that is)
#. Let’s keep a counter. Just in case we want to know how many you
#. stole in the future.
#. Stealing a ship for the first time increases your maximum faction
#. standing.
#. FIXME: We should add a few pursuers. However, if you were able to
#. fight a full squadron of whatever ships are used by the
#. faction to land on the planet, I say you have already done
#. enough. Still, I might be wrong. (:p)
#. If you stole a ship of some value, the faction will have something
#. to say, even if they can only suspect you.
#. This is a success. The player stole his new ship, and everyone is
#. happy with it. Getting out of the system alive is the player’s
#. responsibility, now.
#. A few faction ships guard the target planet.
#. We want the player to be able to land on the destination planet…

#. When he lands on the target planet, he gets a nice message explaining what

#. Then, when the player wants to leave the planet, and that will eventually
#. happen (at least, I hope…) he’ll be pursued by a few fighters.

#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or sructure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.

#. -usage is:
#. Forma:new(fleet,"formation",combat_dist, preferred_fleet_leader)
#. --combat_dist is the distance from the fleet leader to an enemy before the formation breaks and ships attack.

#. Update the ship count if the formation is "buffer".
#. Jump hook. Ensures the entire fleet jumps if the fleader jumps.
#. Takes an ID that tells this function which formation the pilot belonged to.
#. Jumping out is the same as dying, for our purpose; we need to not run this before the if statement.

#. You can add and subtract vec2s as you would expect to, no need to bend over backwards.
#. Formation control function. A wrapper again.
#. Using false instead of nil for readability.
#. A little unconventional, re-set the timer hook at the start of the function. This is because execution might not reach the end.
#. Call the wrapper, not this function.
#. combat. mmmm.
#. Includes the player as an enemy to be iterated over.
#. Iterate over enemies to see if at least one is in range.
#. The inrange variable was already defaulted to false.
#. If an enemy is in range, no need to continue looping.
#. We want to seperate out the for loop that finds enemies and the if functions that control combat, so that all of the enemy pilots are iterated over to see if one is in range before controlling the pilots.
#. It's also easier on my brain. </lazy>
#. If baddies are in range and the fleet isn't set to do combat yet, then...
#. ...cut 'em loose.
#. No need to iterate further. No need to do the rest of this function either!
#. If baddies are in range, and the fleet was already in combat, no need to de-control them again. Prevents spam broadcasting.
#. If no badguys are in range...
#. ...and the fleet is no longer in combat, then...
#. ...flip the combat flag, and continue the function.
#. give the fleader his orders back
#. At this point we know we're not in combat (well, the leader isn't).
#. Assign the coordinates.
#. Remember, there is no need to check if a pilot exists, because we've already made sure all pilots exist.
#. Clear orders.
#. Computing the direction using a pd controller
#. Make mon capitan travel at 5 below the slow speed, so other ships can catch up.
