#. --
#. -- ``set`` is split up into sub-tables that are iterated through. These
#. -- tables include a "num" field which indicates how many of the chosen outfit
#. -- to equip before moving on to the next set; if nil, the chosen outfit will be
#. -- equipped as many times as possible. For example, if you list 3 tables with
#. -- "num" set to 2, 1, and nil respectively, two of an outfit from the first
#. -- table will be equipped, followed by one of an outfit from the second table,
#. -- and then finally all remaining slots will be filled with an outfit from the

#. -- If, rather than equipping multiples of the same outfit you would like to
#. -- select a random outfit `num` times, you can do so by setting "varied" to

#. --
#. -- "probability" can be set to a table specifying the relative chance of each
#. -- outfit (keyed by name) to the other outfits. If unspecified, each outfit
#. -- will have a relative chance of 1. So for example, if the outfits are "Foo",

#. -- chance of being selected; however, with this "probability" table:

#. -- chance, and "Baz" will have a 1/9 chance
#. --
#. -- Note that there should only be one type of outfit (weapons, utilities, or

"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "
"has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtedly "
"send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""

"of the FLF base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your mission "

"\"Everyone,\" a stern-looking but otherwise nondescript Dvaered officer "
"addresses the room, \"If I may have your attention please. I am here to "
"brief you on the upcoming operation, which as you all know revolves around "
"the destruction of the terrorist base known as Sindbad.\"\n"
"    The wall behind the officer lights up, showing a schematic "
"representation of the %s system. In the middle sits a red glowing disc with "
"the FLF logo superimposed over it.\n"
"    \"We're dealing with a fully operational, heavily armed military "
"installation. The FLF may be terrorists, but they're well organized. Since "
"this is their biggest stronghold, we must assume this base is heavily armed, "
"and has a large complement of defensive spacecraft to defend it from attack. "
"We will therefore conduct our assault in two phases.\"\n"
"    The system schematic on the wall updates with a cluster of white Dvaered "
"logos, positioned some distance away from the glowing disc. There are also "
"several white dots which apparently represent the fighter escorts.\n"
"    \"Our strike force will consist out of the HDSF Obstinate, several "
"destroyer escorts and two wings of fighter escorts. In addition, our forces "
"will be joined by citizen %s, who has volunteered to fight on behalf of "
"House Dvaered on this occasion.\" The officer nods at you, then continues "
"his briefing. \"Our forces and formation will be such that it appears we are "
"preparing for a standard strafing run, and indeed this is what will happen "
"if the FLF decide to sit and cower. However, we expect them to put up a "
"fight.\""

"The schematic updates again, this time showing several small clusters of red "
"dots between the glowing disc and the Dvaered formation.\n"
"   \"The FLF will send out wings of fighters and bombers to engage our "
"strike force. At this time the number and composition of ships is unknown, "
"but it seems prudent to assume they will outnumber us by a fair margin. Your "
"task as auxiliary escorts is to protect the strike force's flanks and "
"intercept any FLF ships attempting to target the Obstinate. Be advised that "
"the Obstinate will have limited anti-fighter armaments available, as most of "
"its hull is dedicated to fighter bays. The Obstinate must not be destroyed! "
"This is your paradigm objective!\"\n"
"    On the wall, the red dots are intercepted by the white dots, and blink "
"out of existence. Then a second group of white dots appears near the Dvaered "
"logos, and moves towards the glowing disc.\n"
"    \"As soon as the FLF have exhausted their forces trying to "
"counterattack, the HDSF Obstinate will begin launching bombers. It is our "
"belief that the bombers alone will be able to take out the enemy base, but "
"in the event that resistance is heavier than expected, the Obstinate herself "
"will move in to provide fire support.\"\n"
"    The glowing disc on the wall fades out, leaving the Dvaered fleet alone "
"and victorious.\n"
"    \"That will be all. You have your orders. Report to your stations as per "
"your timetables. I will see you all in %s. Good luck.\"\n"
"    Some time later, you are back in the Dvaered spaceport bar. You've seen "
"action before in your career, but you still feel tense about what is to "
"come. You decide to have another drink, just for luck."

When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
#.
#.
#. This section stores the strings (text) for the mission.
#. Mission details
#. Create the mission on the current planet, and present the first Bar text.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system

#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system when not part of defense
#. Decides what to do when player either takes off starting planet or jumps into another system
#. There's a battle to defend the system
#. Makes the system empty except for the two fleets. No help coming.
#. Set up distances
#. Create a fleet of raiding pirates
#. And a fleet of defending independents
#. How the Battle ends:
#. hook fleet departure to disabling or killing ships
#. Record each raider death and make the raiders flee after too many casualties
#. A few seconds after the raiders start to flee declare victory
#. Call ships back to base
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.
#. A fellow warrior says hello in passing if player jumps out of the system without landing

#. MISSION: Hot dogs from space
#. DESCRIPTION: An old man who owns a hot dog factory wants to go to space
#.
#. The old man has elevated pressure in his cochlea so he can't go to space.
#. He's getting old and wants to go to space before he dies. He owns a hot dog
#. factory and will pay you in hot dogs (food). Because of his illness, you
#. can't land on any planet outside the system (the player doesn't know this).
#.
#. NOTE: This mission is best suited in systems with 2 or more planets, but can
#. be used in any system with a planet.

#. -- The player pays a fellow pirate to know where to steal a random ship.
#.
#. The player pays to get the position of a ship on a random planet of a random
#. faction. When he gets there, the planet is guarded (which means he may have
#. to fight his way through, which is the most probable option).
#.
#. When he lands on the target planet, he gets a nice message explaining what
#. happens, he gets a new ship, is able to refit it, etc.
#.
#. Then, when the player wants to leave the planet, and that will eventually
#. happen (at least, I hope…) he’ll be pursued by a few fighters.

"She continues. \"Several cycles ago, I and Harja were both students at the "
"High Academy on Sinass. It's a very prestigious place among us Sirii, as you "
"may or may not know. It's only one jump away from Mutris itself and... Well, "
"anyway, it's one of the best academies in all of Sirius space, and only the "
"most capable students are even allowed to attend. Now, I don't mean to brag, "
"you understand, but even in that environment I was among the top rated "
"students. And, believe it or not, so was Harja. We were in the same study "
"unit, actually.\n"
"    \"Another thing you should know is that the High Academy offers the very "
"best among its students the chance to advance to the Serra echelon. You're "
"not Sirian so you might not understand, but it's an exceptional honor for "
"those born into the Shaira or Fyrra echelons to rise to a higher echelon. "
"It's extremely valuable to us. So you see, the prospect of being rewarded "
"like that is a very strong motivation for most of the students. It was no "
"different for Harja and myself, since we were both Fyrra echelon. With our "
"abilities, each of us had a good chance of earning the promotion. However, "
"since we were in the same study unit, only one of us could be promoted; only "
"one promotion is awarded per study unit each curriculum. That meant that "
"Harja and I were rivals, but we were rivals in good sport. We each had every "
"intention of winning the promotion through fair competition... Or so I "

"\"After the final exams had been taken and we were only days away from "

"altered the data for the final exams, mine to be exact. My grades had been "
"altered to be straight one hundred percent, in every subject. Can you "
"believe that? Someone had actually tried to make it look like I was "
"cheating. What were they thinking? The academy staff wasn't fooled for even "
"a moment. Nobody would be reckless enough to alter their own scores that "
"way, so the only reason my scores would have been altered is if someone else "
"did it, no doubt in order to discredit me. And you guessed it, the prime "
"suspect was Harja. After all, if I was disqualified, he would certainly have "
"gotten the promotion. Instead, he got what he deserved, and was expelled for "
"his low attempt to secure his own success.\"\n"
"    \"That's basically the history between me and Harja. Up until you came "
"to me, I just thought of him as an untrustworthy man whose own underhanded "
"plan backfired on him. But here we are, cycles later, and now he's trying to "
"kill me. Why, I wonder? Could he really be so bitter over what happened that "
"he wants me dead? Even though he has nobody to blame but himself? I just "
"don't understand it, %s, I really don't.\"\n"
"    Joanne remains silent for a moment, then takes a deep breath. \"Whew, I "

#. Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
#. How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
#. So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
#. I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?

#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent

#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.

#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,

#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.

#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.

#. Iterate over enemies to see if at least one is in range.
#. The inrange variable was already defaulted to false.
#. If an enemy is in range, no need to continue looping.
#. We want to separate out the for loop that finds enemies and the if functions that control combat, so that all of the enemy pilots are iterated over to see if one is in range before controlling the pilots.
#. It's also easier on my brain. </lazy>
#. If baddies are in range and the fleet isn't set to do combat yet, then...
#. ...cut 'em loose.
#. No need to iterate further. No need to do the rest of this function either!
#. If baddies are in range, and the fleet was already in combat, no need to de-control them again. Prevents spam broadcasting.
#. If no badguys are in range...
#. ...and the fleet is no longer in combat, then...
#. ...flip the combat flag, and continue the function.
#. give the fleader his orders back
#. At this point we know we're not in combat (well, the leader isn't).
