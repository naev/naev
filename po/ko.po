"When Major Tam arrives at the point where the turtle was when he started to "

"   Strafer then arrives: \"Yep, I've been to the museum of Theras one day, "
"and this riddle was written on a book from before the space age. The name of "

"medium and heavy ships and to provide anti-heavy firepower in case of need. "
"Our squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts "
"and Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.\n"
"   \"The procedure is the following: any ship approaching the station will "
"be assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad "
"leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is attributed to you, you will have to "
"approach the ship within 1000 m. Their security clearance code will be "
"automatically requested and processed by the system we install right now on "
"your core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to "
"fly away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.\n"
"   \"Finally, in case something unexpected happens, you will of course have "
"to obey to orders. Watch your messages closely. A few pilots will be kept in "
"reserve close to the station.\n"
"   \"Oh, and there is another point I must warn you about: it's the "

#. -- 5. Scavengers show up and talk about sensors not working well, talk through broadcast. Player has to follow without getting too close (maybe needs outfits to improve sensor range in nebula?)
#. -- 6. They lead the player to some debris and start looting. Player gets to talk to them and convince to leave, or kill them. Learns that Za'lek have been buying the goods.

#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission

#. MISSION: Defend the System 2
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the second in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third mission, perhaps there'll be a regular diet of similar missions
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission

#. I'm joking about the last line a little. If you want to name him, feel free.

"    \"Ha! Of course it was going to be you. Who else would that lass Rebina "
"send? She's tough as nails, that girl, but I know how her mind works. She's "
"cornered, potential enemies behind every door in the organization. And you "
"have done us a couple of favors already. In fact, you're the only one she "
"can trust outside her own little circle of friends, and right now I'm not "
"too sure how far she trusts those. Plus, she really has a keen nose when it "
"comes to sniffin' out reliable people, and she knows it. Yeah, I knew she'd "
"send you to find me.\"\n"
"    That answers one question. But you still don't know why Jorek hasn't "
"been reporting in like he should have.\n"
"    \"Yeah, right, about that. You know about the deal with the other "
"branches getting too big for their britches? Good. Well, I've been lookin' "
"into that, pokin' my nose into their business. Since I'm dealin' with my "

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
#. Generate a deduplicated list.

#. core outfit slots.
