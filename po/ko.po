"\"I'm sure you're wondering who we are. We are the Thurion, a civilization left over from one of the Empire's former secret projects. Have you met the Za'lek? The Collective? Those too were the Empire's \"great projects\", as were the now dead Proteron. But we were kept a lot more in the dark.\n"
"    \"You see, when the Empire gave up on Project Thurion many cycles ago, they tried to kill us so that word of our existence would never get out. They thought us an embarrassment to the Empire. Little did they know, however, that we had discovered a method of uploading the human mind to a computer, and so when they came after us, we uploaded ourselves and escaped into what are now our core systems to rebuild.\""

"\"Now, about half of us are uploaded, myself included. This face you see and this voice you hear are but projections, a reflection of myself that I have freely chosen. Being uploaded is wonderful, I must say; there is no suffering, we are immortal, and we can have whatever human experiences we desire and much more. And when we decide we have lived to our fullest, we can delete ourselves and disappear into the emptiness just like any other person does when they die. It's not uncommon for people to choose to self-terminate after they have been uploaded for about 200 cycles or so. I, however, have stuck around from the very beginning. I very much enjoy seeing the biological Thurion grow, learn, and join us in uploaded consciousness when their human bodies grow old and weary.\n"

The uploading process tends to fail with people who have even the slightest brain damage, and you outsiders usually drink far too many brain-damaging substances.

"Fascinated, you finally speak up, prompting a smile from the uploaded Thurion and a fairly long, friendly discussion about her experiences as an uploaded Thurion and your experience as a pilot on the outside. You find out that her name is Alicia. Somewhere in the conversation, a pair of human Thurion guards enters the room. They ask Alicia how it went, and she says that you've been properly introduced to Thurion culture and can be trusted to roam free. The two guards then smile and shake your hand. \"Welcome to the nebula, %s,\" one of them says. \"You now have permission to roam Thurion space freely and conduct your business. Of course, I trust you won't reveal our secret location to anyone. That would be just as bad for you as it would be for us.\"\n"

You are our honored guest and, I hope, the first of many outsiders to learn the wonders of our way of life.\"\n"

See, when operating a larger ship, you have to expend more time and effort performing the basic operations of the ship, causing your perception of time to speed up. Time Dilation is simply a measure of how fast you will perceive the passage of time compared to a typical small ship; for example, a Time Dilation rating of 200%% means that time appears to pass twice as fast as typical small ships.\n"

For the largest classes - Destroyers and up - I would generally recommend use of turreted weapons, which will automatically aim at your opponent, rather than forward-facing weapons. That's of course up to you, though.\n"

#. --
#. -- ``set`` is split up into sub-tables that are iterated through. These
#. -- tables include a "num" field which indicates how many of the chosen outfit
#. -- to equip before moving on to the next set; if nil, the chosen outfit will be
#. -- equipped as many times as possible. For example, if you list 3 tables with
#. -- "num" set to 2, 1, and nil respectively, two of an outfit from the first
#. -- table will be equipped, followed by one of an outfit from the second table,
#. -- and then finally all remaining slots will be filled with an outfit from the
#. -- third table.
#. --
#. -- If, rather than equipping multiples of the same outfit you would like to
#. -- select a random outfit `num` times, you can do so by setting "varied" to
#. -- true.
#. --
#. -- "probability" can be set to a table specifying the relative chance of each
#. -- outfit (keyed by name) to the other outfits. If unspecified, each outfit
#. -- will have a relative chance of 1. So for example, if the outfits are "Foo",
#. -- "Bar", and "Baz", with no "probability" table, each outfit will have a 1/3
#. -- chance of being selected; however, with this "probability" table:
#. --
#. --    probability = { ["Foo"] = 6, ["Bar"] = 2 }
#. --
#. -- This will lead to "Foo" having a 6/9 (2/3) chance, "Bar" will have a 2/9
#. -- chance, and "Baz" will have a 1/9 chance
#. --
#. -- Note that there should only be one type of outfit (weapons, utilities, or
#. -- structurals) in ``set``; including multiple types will prevent proper
#. -- detection of how many are needed.
#. --
#. Add entries based on "probability".

You will find him on %s in the %s system. Simply tell him you're working for me and show him any artifacts in your possession. He will tell you which are authentic and which are fake.\n"

"   \"It's called a skate-board,\" Flintley continues. \"The records about it are a bit sketchy and a lot is nothing but conjecture, but it appears it was once used in primitive communal rituals. The exact nature of these rituals is unknown, but they may have been tribal initiations or even mating rituals. The patterns in the board itself are thought to have a spiritual or mystical meaning. Also, according to some theories, people used to stand on top of the skate-board, with the cylinder wheels facing the ground. This has led some historians to believe that the feet were once central to human psychology.\"\n"

"   \"I was right to send you, %s, you've beautifully lived up to my expectations. And I'm a man of my word, I will reward you as promised. What was it we agreed on again? What, I never promised you anything? Well, that won't do. I'll have my assistant place a suitable amount of money in your account. You will not find me ungrateful! Ah, but you must excuse me. I need time to revel in this fantastic piece of art! Goodbye, %s, I will call on you when I have need of you again.\"\n"

The first thing you do is check your balance, and to your relief, it has indeed been upgraded by a substantial amount. You also seem to have received a statue of dubious taste. As you undock, you wonder what kind of wild goose chase the man will send you on next time."

We know this base is located somewhere in the nebula, and we have recently uncovered intel that indicates the base is likely to be in the %s system.\"\n"

Our sensors are severely impaired by the nebula in this system, so the chances of us finding the terrorist hive by our own devices are slim. Fortunately, our top strategists have come up with a ruse, one that will make the FLF come to us.\"\n"
"    \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" Urnus continues. The image on the wall zooms up to the %s system, and a white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since you look like one of them.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtedly send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""

This is vital to the success of the mission. Do not fail.\"\n"

"    \"In the near future, the Dvaered fleet will move against enemies of the state in the %s system. The objective is to seek out and destroy all hostiles. This operation will be headed by the HDSF Obstinate, and all units in this battle will defer to its commanding officer, regardless of class and rank. The Obstinate and its battle group will concentrate on performing bombing runs on the primary target. Your task as an auxiliary unit will be to secure the flanks and engage any hostiles that threaten the success of the mission. Note that once you enter the combat theater, you are considered committed, and your leaving the system will be seen as an act of cowardice and treachery.\"\n"

"    The liaison hands you a small access card. It bears the emblem of the Dvaered military. It seems you've been granted a level of clearance that goes beyond that of a civilian volunteer.\n"
"    The liaison stands up, offers a curt greeting and walks out of the bar. You remain for a while, since you're not due for your briefing for some time yet. You reflect on your recent achievements. Your actions have drastically dipped the balance of power between the Dvaered and the FLF insurgents, and soon you will be able to see the results of your decisions with your own two eyes. You feel a sense of accomplishment to know you're making a difference in this galaxy.\n"
"    Several periods later, you find yourself in a functional, sterile briefing room at the Dvaered military base. You are joined by several Dvaered pilots, who are clearly going to be participating in the upcoming battle as well."

"\"Everyone,\" a stern-looking but otherwise nondescript Dvaered officer addresses the room, \"If I may have your attention please. I am here to brief you on the upcoming operation, which as you all know revolves around the destruction of the terrorist base known as Sindbad.\"\n"
"    The wall behind the officer lights up, showing a schematic representation of the %s system. In the middle sits a red glowing disc with the FLF logo superimposed over it.\n"
"    \"We're dealing with a fully operational, heavily armed military installation. The FLF may be terrorists, but they're well organized. Since this is their biggest stronghold, we must assume this base is heavily armed, and has a large complement of defensive spacecraft to defend it from attack. We will therefore conduct our assault in two phases.\"\n"
"    The system schematic on the wall updates with a cluster of white Dvaered logos, positioned some distance away from the glowing disc. There are also several white dots which apparently represent the fighter escorts.\n"
"    \"Our strike force will consist out of the HDSF Obstinate, several destroyer escorts and two wings of fighter escorts. In addition, our forces will be joined by citizen %s, who has volunteered to fight on behalf of House Dvaered on this occasion.\" The officer nods at you, then continues his briefing. \"Our forces and formation will be such that it appears we are preparing for a standard strafing run, and indeed this is what will happen if the FLF decide to sit and cower. However, we expect them to put up a fight.\""

"The schematic updates again, this time showing several small clusters of red dots between the glowing disc and the Dvaered formation.\n"
"   \"The FLF will send out wings of fighters and bombers to engage our strike force. At this time the number and composition of ships is unknown, but it seems prudent to assume they will outnumber us by a fair margin. Your task as auxiliary escorts is to protect the strike force's flanks and intercept any FLF ships attempting to target the Obstinate. Be advised that the Obstinate will have limited anti-fighter armaments available, as most of its hull is dedicated to fighter bays. The Obstinate must not be destroyed! This is your paradigm objective!\"\n"
"    On the wall, the red dots are intercepted by the white dots, and blink out of existence. Then a second group of white dots appears near the Dvaered logos, and moves towards the glowing disc.\n"
"    \"As soon as the FLF have exhausted their forces trying to counterattack, the HDSF Obstinate will begin launching bombers. It is our belief that the bombers alone will be able to take out the enemy base, but in the event that resistance is heavier than expected, the Obstinate herself will move in to provide fire support.\"\n"
"    The glowing disc on the wall fades out, leaving the Dvaered fleet alone and victorious.\n"
"    \"That will be all. You have your orders. Report to your stations as per your timetables. I will see you all in %s. Good luck.\"\n"
"    Some time later, you are back in the Dvaered spaceport bar. You've seen action before in your career, but you still feel tense about what is to come. You decide to have another drink, just for luck."

"When you step out of your ship, a Dvaered military delegation is waiting for you. Normally this wouldn't be a good thing, as the Dvaered military typically see civilians as mobile patches of air, unless they've done something wrong. But this case is an exception. The soldiers politely escort you to the office of Colonel Urnus, the man who got you involved in this operation in the first place.\n"
"    \"Well met, citizen %s,\" Urnus tells you. \"Cigar? Oh. Well, suit yourself. Anyway, I wanted to personally thank you for your role in the recent victory against the FLF. If it hadn't been for the information you provided we might have never smoked out their nest! In addition, your efforts on the battlefield have helped to secure our victory. House Dvaered recognizes accomplishments like that, citizen.\"\n"
"    The Colonel walks to a cabinet in his office and takes out a small box. From the box, he produces a couple of credit chips as well as a small metal pin in the shape of a star.\n"
"    \"This is a reward for your services. The money speaks for itself, of course. As for the pin, it's a civilian commendation, the Star of Valor. Think of it as a badge of honor. It isn't a medal, but it's considered a mark of prestige among the Dvaered citizenry nonetheless.

We may have dealt them a mortal blow by taking out their hidden base, but as long as rebel sentiment runs high among the Frontier worlds, they will rear their ugly heads again. That means my job isn't over, and maybe it means yours isn't either. Perhaps in the future we'll work together again - but this time it won't be just about removing a threat on our doorstep.\" Urnus smiles grimly. \"It will be about rooting out the source of the problem once and for all.\"\n"
"    As you walk the corridor that leads out of the military complex, the Star of Valor glinting on your lapel, you find yourself thinking about what your decisions might ultimately lead to. Colonel Urnus hinted at war on the Frontier, and he also indicated that you would be involved. While the Dvaered have been treating you as well as can be expected from a military regime, perhaps you might want to reconsider your allegiance when the time comes..."

When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

I had just got off this 72 hour run through pirate infested space though, and I was all hopped up on grasshoppers without a hatch to jump. So I decided to get a drink or two and hit the hay. Turned out those drinks er two got a little procreation goin' on and turned into three or twelve. Maybe twenty. I don't know, but they didn't seem too liking to my gamblin', as next thing I knew, I was wakin' up with water splashed on my face, bein' tellered I gots in the hock, and they gots me ship, ye know? But hey, all yous gotta do is go pick up whatever it is she wants at %s in the %s system. I doubt it's anything too hot, but I also doubt it's kittens and rainbows. All I ask is 25 percent. So just go get it, deliver it to %s in the %s system, and don't ask any questions. And if she's there when you drop it off, just tell her I sent you. And don't you be lookin' at her too untoforward, or um, uh, you know what I mean.\" You figure you better take off before the drinks he's had take any more hold on him, and the bottle sucks you in."

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
#.
#.
#. This section stores the strings (text) for the mission.
#. Mission details
#. Create the mission on the current planet, and present the first Bar text.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system
#. hook warm reception to player landing
#. If player didn't accept the mission, the battle's still on, but player has no stake.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system when not part of defense
#. Decides what to do when player either takes off starting planet or jumps into another system
#. There's a battle to defend the system
#. Makes the system empty except for the two fleets. No help coming.
#. Set up distances
#. Create a fleet of raiding pirates
#. And a fleet of defending independents
#. How the Battle ends:
#. hook fleet departure to disabling or killing ships
#. Record each raider death and make the raiders flee after too many casualties
#. A few seconds after the raiders start to flee declare victory
#. Call ships back to base
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.
#. A fellow warrior says hello in passing if player jumps out of the system without landing

No fuel, no food and only auxiliary power to sustain us.\" He then begins to incoherently tell you how much his group has suffered in the past few periods, but you cut him short, not willing to put up with his endless babbling.\n"
"    With a few to-the-point questions you learn that the man's name is Harrus, and that he and his wife and children live, or at least used to live, aboard their trading vessel. \"It was a good life, you know,\" Harrus tells you. \"You get to see the galaxy, meet people and see planets, and all that while working from home because, haha, you take your home with you!\"\n"

"    Then Harrus brightens up, apparently putting his recent misfortune behind him in the blink of an eye. \"Everything's going to be fine now,\" he says cheerfully. \"We've been rescued, and all we need now is for you to take us to a suitable world where we can build a new life.\"\n"

Do you want my children to grow up believing the sky is supposed to look like, like... like THAT?\" Harrus again looks up at the heavens that offend him so. \"No, captain, my patience is at an end. I expect you to take me and my family to %s in the %s system. We've got relatives there who will take us in. I will waste my time with this pointless endeavour no longer!\" \n"

You console yourself with the thought that at least you'll have something to do during the dull periods in hyperspace and turn to tend to your ships needs, when your eye falls on a small box that you don't remember seeing here before.\n"

Well, suffice to say that increasing the tension between the two is definitely not part of our mandate. In fact, it's completely at odds with what we stand for.

We have been with human civilization throughout the ages, at first only in the Eastern nations, later establishing a foothold worldwide. Our purpose was to guide humanity, prevent it from making mistakes it could not afford to make. We never came out in the open, we always worked behind the scenes, from the shadows. We were diplomats, scientists, journalists, politicians' spouses, sometimes even assassins. We used any means necessary to gather information and avert disaster, when we could.\n"
"    \"Of course, we didn't always succeed. We couldn't prevent the nuclear strikes on Japan, though we managed to prevent several others. We foiled the sabotage attempts on several of the colony ships launched during the First Growth, but sadly failed to do so in Maelstrom's case. We failed to stop the Faction Wars, though we managed to help the Empire gain the upper hand.

There are... rivalries out there, and working for me will mean you'll take sides in some of them. People will take notice of you, and some of them will try to kill you.\"\n"
"    You explain that taking risks comes with being an independent pilot and that you took the captain's chair with appropriate resolve, but Rebina pins you with a piercing gaze. \"These are no ordinary pirate raids we're talking about,\" she admonishes you. \"If you take this assignment, you will be a painted target. I want you to be well aware of this.\" There is another pause, but then she continues in a milder tone of voice. \"That being said, I can assure you that the reward is well worth the risk.

It's about a man who goes by the name of Jorek McArthy. The current state of affairs is that Jorek is staying on %s in the %s system, and this is not where me and my associates want him to be. Unfortunately, Jorek has attracted some unwanted attention, and we don't want him to focus that attention to us.\"\n"

You are to rendezvous with Jorek, take him aboard your ship, lose whoever's tailing him, then bring him to the %s system. There you will dock with one of our ships, the %s, which will take Jorek to his final destination. You will receive your reward from her captain once Jorek is aboard.\"\n"

If you fail to meet with Jorek within the time limit or if you are prevented from taking him offworld for any other reason, make your way to the %s and report what happened. We'll take it from there. If you fail to show up at the designated time, we will assume you have failed, and the %s will leave.\"\n"
"    Rebina empties her glass and places it on the bar before rising to her feet. \"That will be all. Good luck, and keep your wits about you.\"\n"

"You dock with the Seiryuu and shut down your engines. At the airlock, you are welcomed by two nondescript crewmen in gray uniforms who tell you to follow them into the ship. They lead you through corridors and passages that seem to lead to the bridge. On the way, you can't help but look around you in wonder. The ship isn't anything you're used to seeing. While some parts can be identified as such common features as doors and viewports, a lot of the equipment in the compartments and niches seems strange, almost alien to you. Clearly the Seiryuu is not just any other Kestrel.\n"
"    On the bridge, you immediately spot - who else - the Seiryuu's captain, Rebina, seated in the captain's chair. The chair, too, is designed in the strange fashion that you've been seeing all over the ship. It sports several controls that you can't place, despite the fact that you're an experienced pilot yourself. The rest of the bridge is no different. All the regular stations and consoles seem to be there, but there are some others whose purpose you can only guess.\n"
"    Rebina swivels the chair around and smiles when she sees you. \"Ah, %s,\" she says. \"How good of you to come. I was hoping you'd get my invitation, since I was quite pleased with your performance last time. And I'm not the only one. As it turns out Jorek seems to have taken a liking to you as well. He may seem rough, but he's a good man at heart.\""

"You choose not to say anything, but Rebina seems to have no trouble reading what's on your mind. \"Ah yes, the ship. It's understandable that you're surprised at how it looks. I can't divulge too much about this technology or how we came to possess it, but suffice to say that we don't buy from the regular outlets. We have need for... an edge in our line of business.\"\n"
"    Grateful for the opening, you ask Rebina what exactly this line of business is. Rebina flashes you a quick smile and settles into the chair for the explanation.\n"
"    \"The organization I'm part of is known as the Four Winds, or rather,\" she gestures dismissively, \"not known as the Four Winds. We keep a low profile. You won't have heard of us before, I'm sure. At this point I should add that many who do know us refer to us as the 'Shadows', but this is purely a colloquial name. It doesn't cover what we do, certainly. In any event, you can think of us as a private operation with highly specific objectives. At this point that is all I can tell you.\" She leans forward and fixes you with a level stare. \"Speaking of specific objectives, I have one such objective for you.\""

"\"You may not know this, but there are tensions between the Imperial and Dvaered militaries. For some time now there have been incidents on the border, conflicts about customs, pilots disrespecting each other's flight trajectories, that sort of thing. It hasn't become a public affair yet, and the respective authorities don't want it to come to that. This is why they've arranged a secret diplomatic meeting to smooth things over and make arrangements to de-escalate the situation.\n"
"    \"This is where we come in. Without going into the details, suffice to say we have an interest in making sure that this meeting does not meet with any unfortunate accidents. However, for reasons I can't explain to you now, we can't become involved directly. That's why I want you to go on our behalf.\n"
"    \"You will essentially be flying an escort mission. You will rendezvous with a small wing of private fighters, who will take you to your charge, the Imperial representative. Once there, you will protect him from any threats you might encounter, and see him safely to Dvaered space. As soon as the Imperial representative has joined his Dvaered colleague, your mission will be complete and you will report back here.\n"

For various reasons, it is best that you refrain from communication with the other escorts as much as possible. I think you might have an inkling as to why.\"\n"

You saw what happened. The diplomats were killed by their own escorts - by Four Winds operatives! This is an outrage!\"\n"
"    Captain Rebina brings herself back under control through an effort of will. \"%s, this does not bode well. We have a problem, and I fear I'm going to need your help again before the end. But not yet. I have a lot to do. I have to get to the bottom of this, and I have to try to keep this situation from escalating into a disaster. I will contact you again when I know more. In the mean time, you will have the time to spend your reward - it's already in your account.\"\n"

"    \"Listen, I need to explain some background. As you know, Nexus designs are used far and wide in smaller militaries. The Empire is definitely our biggest customer, but the Frontier also notably makes heavy use of our Lancelot design, as do many independent systems. Still, competition is stiff; House Dvaered's Vendetta design, for instance, is quite popular with the FLF, ironically enough.\n"
"    \"But matters just got a little worse for us: it seems that House Sirius is looking to get in on the shipbuilding business as well, and the Frontier are prime targets. If they succeed, the Lancelot design could be completely pushed out of Frontier space, and we would be crushed in that market between House Dvaered and House Sirius. Sure, the FLF would still be using a few Pacifiers, but it would be a token business at best, and not to mention the authorities would start associating us with terrorism.\n"
"    \"So we've conducted a bit of espionage. We have an agent who has recorded some hopefully revealing conversations between a House Sirius sales manager and representatives of the Frontier. All we need you to do is meet with the agent, get the recordings, and bring them back to me on %s in the %s system.\" You raise an eyebrow.\n"

"\"Hello again. As you know, I've agreed with the FLF on a contract that will extend our sales of ships to them substantially. Of course, this deal must remain a secret, which is why it is being done through a false black market dealer.\n"
"    \"However, we have reason to suspect that a few key influential pirates may have their eyes on the FLF as possible buyers of the Skull and Bones pirate ships. We don't think the FLF will have any interest in those ships, but the pirates' ambitions could give them motivation to attack our false dealer's trade posts, destroying our deal with the FLF anyway. We of course can't have that.\n"
"    \"So what we want you to do, quite simply, is to eliminate these pirates. It's not that many of them; there are four pirates we need eliminated, and thankfully, they're all spread out. That being said, some of them do have quite big ships, so you will have to make sure you can handle that. Are you willing to do this job for us?\""

"You find a young Fyrra man sitting uncomfortably amidst the uncouth characters that frequent the Wringer. He seems to be here with a purpose, but nobody seems to be giving him the time of day. Curious, you decide to talk to the man and find out why he is here.\n"
"    \"Well met, stranger,\" the young Sirian greets you. \"My name is Harja. I'm looking for someone who can help me with this... problem I have, it requires some violence. But nobody I've talked to so far seems interested! I thought this place was supposed to be filled with mercenaries and killers for hire. I can't believe how difficult this is!\"\n"

This woman did something to me cycles ago that just can't go unpunished. I've got money, I'm willing to pay. All you need to do is locate her, and discreetly take her out. I don't care how you do it. I don't even care if you enjoy it. Just come back when she's dead, and I'll pay you 400,000 credits. Do we have a deal?\""

Come back to me when she's dead, and I'll give you your reward!\"\n"
"    Harja leaves the spacedock bar, satisfied that he's finally found someone to take his request. You can't help but wonder why he would try to hire a mercenary in a place like the Wringer, though. If the target is such a dangerous criminal, then wouldn't he be better off posting a bounty mission on the public board? Oh well, it's none of your business.

Yes, there is bad blood between us, it's rather personal. But as you can see my record is clean, or I wouldn't have been accepted into the military.\n"

Now, it seems I may have a situation to take care of...\"\n"

As you can see I'm still doing quite well, no poison in my wine or snakes in my bed or anything.\" Then her expression turns more serious. \"Actually, about that. I think our friend Harja still has it in for me. You had the common sense to use your head, but I'm afraid not everyone is like that. I'm convinced Harja will try to hire more assassins to do what you didn't, so I'm in considerable danger.\"\n"

I've had combat training, of course, just like every other Serra soldier, but I'm afraid I have little actual fighting experience, and I'm not sure I could survive an attack unassisted. You, however, seem to have seen quite some action. If you were to escort me while I make my rounds, I would feel a lot more secure. I can reward you, of course. Let's see... Another 750,000 credits seems a fair sum. What do you think, are you willing to do it?\""

"    \"Also, I think this goes without saying, but I need you to stick close to me so your ship must be fast enough. Also don't jump to any systems before I do, don't jump to the wrong systems, and don't land on any planets I don't land on.

"She continues. \"Several cycles ago, I and Harja were both students at the High Academy on Sinass. It's a very prestigious place among us Sirii, as you may or may not know. It's only one jump away from Mutris itself and... Well, anyway, it's one of the best academies in all of Sirius space, and only the most capable students are even allowed to attend. Now, I don't mean to brag, you understand, but even in that environment I was among the top rated students. And, believe it or not, so was Harja. We were in the same study unit, actually.\n"
"    \"Another thing you should know is that the High Academy offers the very best among its students the chance to advance to the Serra echelon. You're not Sirian so you might not understand, but it's an exceptional honor for those born into the Shaira or Fyrra echelons to rise to a higher echelon. It's extremely valuable to us. So you see, the prospect of being rewarded like that is a very strong motivation for most of the students. It was no different for Harja and myself, since we were both Fyrra echelon. With our abilities, each of us had a good chance of earning the promotion. However, since we were in the same study unit, only one of us could be promoted; only one promotion is awarded per study unit each curriculum. That meant that Harja and I were rivals, but we were rivals in good sport. We each had every intention of winning the promotion through fair competition... Or so I thought.\""

"\"After the final exams had been taken and we were only days away from receiving the results, there was an incident. There had been a security breach in the academy's main computer. Someone had hacked the system and altered the data for the final exams, mine to be exact. My grades had been altered to be straight one hundred percent, in every subject. Can you believe that? Someone had actually tried to make it look like I was cheating. What were they thinking? The academy staff wasn't fooled for even a moment. Nobody would be reckless enough to alter their own scores that way, so the only reason my scores would have been altered is if someone else did it, no doubt in order to discredit me. And you guessed it, the prime suspect was Harja. After all, if I was disqualified, he would certainly have gotten the promotion. Instead, he got what he deserved, and was expelled for his low attempt to secure his own success.\"\n"
"    \"That's basically the history between me and Harja. Up until you came to me, I just thought of him as an untrustworthy man whose own underhanded plan backfired on him. But here we are, cycles later, and now he's trying to kill me. Why, I wonder? Could he really be so bitter over what happened that he wants me dead? Even though he has nobody to blame but himself? I just don't understand it, %s, I really don't.\"\n"
"    Joanne remains silent for a moment, then takes a deep breath. \"Whew, I feel quite a bit better now for having told this to you. Thanks for listening, it means a lot to me. I shouldn't keep you here any longer though, I'm sure you have a lot of other problems to look after.\"\n"

It's been giving me sleepless nights. I don't mind admitting that I'm a little scared that someone out there is trying to kill me, but that's not everything. I know Harja, or at least I knew him for cycles. These assassinations, the whole fraud, it doesn't add up with the image I had of him. I've been thinking what to do about it, but I'm not sure. I considered reporting the matter to my superiors and let the armed forces handle it, and that would probably be the end of it, but I can't shake the feeling that I would never be free from these doubts I'm having.\n"

Just make sure to find out what his motives are and what it'll take for him to leave the past alone. But!\" and here Joanne's face turns stern, \"I don't want any serious harm to come to him. You may be thinking that removing Harja will solve the problem, but even if he's a threat to my life, murder is still murder. This is a private investigation, not a private war. Are we clear?\"\n"
"    You acknowledge that you won't kill Harja if you can possibly help it. This seems to satisfy Joanne.\n"
"    \"Good. I know I can trust you, %s. I can offer you 1,000,000 credits if you complete this job. Go find Harja. Make him talk. Then come back and tell me what he said. Maybe, hopefully, it'll put my mind at rest.\""

"\"Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Here, I'll upload the details of Harja's private ship into your computer. I did some digging in the military database to find them. You don't graduate from the Sinass High Academy with honors without picking up a few tricks! I know, I know, it's classified data, but it's for a good cause, wouldn't you say? You should be able to identify Harja when you pick him up on your sensors now. If you have trouble locating him, consider installing better sensors on your ship so you can pick him up from farther away. But don't spend too much effort looking for him, just keep a look out as you go about your normal business. If you just stay in Sirius space, I'm sure you'll run into him sooner or later.\"\n"

"    \"What do you mean, my side of the story?\" Harja grumbles after you've explained your actions. \"I'm taking revenge, that's all there is to it. Did she tell you about the academy on Sinass? Okay. Did she also tell you how she framed me for the computer hack? No, I bet she didn't! But that's the truth of it, mark my words! She knew I was at least as good as she was, so she needed to get rid of me to be sure she'd get the promotion. Oh yeah, she's a clever one, is Joanne. She knew nobody would believe she'd try to forge her own scores, and everyone knew I was her only competition. So she set me up! Just to get me expelled!

And now you either believe me or you believe her. I've told you everything.\"\n"

Both Harja and Joanne seem convinced that the other hacked the academy's computer, and neither of them has any evidence to prove their claim.

From what you told me, it doesn't seem like he was just putting up a self-righteous story to justify his actions, and I wouldn't expect that from him anyway. But that's impossible. Besides the two of us, there was nobody who had the slightest interest in removing either one of us from the academy. I know I didn't do it, so that means Harja must have done it. Only...\" Joanne pauses. \"You said he swore an oath. Whatever else I might think of him, I can't quite believe he would abuse his Sirian beliefs in such a way. We Sirii take our faith very seriously.\n"

#. Anxious Merchant
#. Author: PhoenixRiver (from an idea on the wiki)
#.
#. A merchant with a slow ship suddenly realizes he can't make the delivery and
#. implores the player to do it for him. Since he has to look good with his
#. employers he'll pay the player a bonus if he does it.
#.
#. Note: Variant of the Drunkard and Rush Cargo missions combined

#. Mission: The one with the Runaway
#. Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
#. How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
#. So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
#. I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?
#. Difficulty: relatively easy?

#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.

#.
#. Usage:
#. First create a fleet with pilot.add()
#. Then pass that to the Forma:new() function.
#. Then use Forma:setTask() to control the fleader
#. -usage is:
#. Forma:new(fleet,"formation",combat_dist, preferred_fleet_leader)
#. --combat_dist is the distance from the fleet leader to an enemy before the formation breaks and ships attack.
#. --preferred_fleet_leader is the ship you want to be leader. if that ship dies, the scripts hands leadership to another ship.
#. -if formation or distance isn't provided, formation will be "circle" and distance will be 3000
#. Control the fleet's movements by controlling the fleet leader, or "fleader".
#.
#. example:
#. my_fleet = pilot.add("Pirate Hyena Pack")
#. my_fleet = Forma:new(my_fleet,"echelon left",1500)
#. my_fleet:setTask("goto",vec2.new(0,0))
#.
#. Current formations are:
#. buffer            echelon left
#. cross             echelon right
#. wedge             wall
#. vee               column
#. circle            fishbone
#. chevron
#.
#.
#.
#. First define the base object. There are no default values, I only wrote in the variables for reader reference.
#. The functions below that start with Forma: are all elements of the Forma table above.
#. Every such function is automatically passed the Forma object they are called on.
#. This object is referenced as "self".
#. Create a new object based on the Forma "class".

#. Combat flag, used in the controlling function.
#. Death function. Removes a pilot from a fleet and reorganizes the fleet if necessary.
#. This will automatically reorganize the table, so there won't be any entries for pilots that have been removed.
#. Don't keep iterating after a table.remove, as it can cause trouble.
#. can't have a fleet with one ship.
#. Now, if our fleet has been completely wiped out, we need to clean up.
#. if the scripter set a lead ship which dies, set the lead_ship to nil.
#. We need to update the fleet's organization if the leader got killed.
#. Update the ship count if the formation is "buffer".
#. Jump hook. Ensures the entire fleet jumps if the fleader jumps.
#. Takes an ID that tells this function which formation the pilot belonged to.
#. Jumping out is the same as dying, for our purpose; we need to not run this before the if statement.
#. Make the whole fleet use the jump.
#. control pilots or clear their orders.
#. Stop the control loop, or it will override our hyperspace() order.

#. Land hook. Ensures the entire fleet lands if the fleader lands.
#. Takes an ID that tells this function which formation the pilot belonged to.
#. Landing is the same as dying, for our purpose.
#. Have the fleet land on the asset.
#. control pilots or clear their orders.
#. Stop the control loop, or it will override our land() order.
#. Hooks. The hook functions are just wrappers for the Forma functions.
#. We need these because hooks can't reference table elements as their callbacks.
#. Used in formation creation, this creates vec2s for each ship to follow.
#. Defined on a formation table.
#. This is where formations will ultimately be defined.
#. setup
#. position array. I'm using this twice, once for polar coordinates and once for absolute vec2s.
#. Readability.
#. A fleet of 1 ship or less has no business flying in formation.

#. Cross logic. Forms an X.
#. Spokes start rotated at a 45 degree angle.
#. First ship distance.
#. Store as polar coordinates.
#. Rotate spokes by 90 degrees.
#. Increase the radius every 4 positions.
#. buffer formation
#. Buffer logic. Consecutive arcs emanating from the fleader. Stored as polar coordinates.

#. captain is facing, not static offsets.
#. convert to radians
#. x coordinate assignment.
#. y coordinate assignment.
#. You can add and subtract vec2s as you would expect to, no need to bend over backwards.
#. Formation control function. A wrapper again.
#. Using false instead of nil for readability.
#. A little unconventional, re-set the timer hook at the start of the function. This is because execution might not reach the end.
#. Call the wrapper, not this function.
#. combat. mmmm.
#. Includes the player as an enemy to be iterated over.
#. Iterate over enemies to see if at least one is in range.
#. The inrange variable was already defaulted to false.
#. If an enemy is in range, no need to continue looping.
#. We want to separate out the for loop that finds enemies and the if functions that control combat, so that all of the enemy pilots are iterated over to see if one is in range before controlling the pilots.
#. It's also easier on my brain. </lazy>
#. If baddies are in range and the fleet isn't set to do combat yet, then...
#. ...cut 'em loose.
#. No need to iterate further. No need to do the rest of this function either!
#. If baddies are in range, and the fleet was already in combat, no need to de-control them again. Prevents spam broadcasting.
#. If no badguys are in range...
#. ...and the fleet is no longer in combat, then...
#. ...flip the combat flag, and continue the function.
#. give the fleader his orders back
#. At this point we know we're not in combat (well, the leader isn't).
#. Assign the coordinates.
#. Remember, there is no need to check if a pilot exists, because we've already made sure all pilots exist.
#. Clear orders.
#. Computing the direction using a pd controller
#. Make mon capitan travel at 5 below the slow speed, so other ships can catch up.
#. Logic for fleet leader goes here. For now, let's allow the fleader to act according to the regular AI.
