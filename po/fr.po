msgid ""
"The second part of the scientists' plan was the activation of a transmitter "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They assumed that the Empire would forget about project Thurion after some "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By that time, however, the system was still under lock down and Empire "

msgstr ""

msgid "Soon enough they would find the hidden bunker."
msgstr ""

"But in [UST 307](mechanics/time) [the Dvaered revolts](lore/history) "

msgid ""
"They were greeted by a hologram that not only claimed to be a human but also "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because the uploaded individuals need only energy and basic maintenance, "

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "They had no intentions to grow further."
msgstr ""

msgid "The size of the organization was large enough to sustain itself."

msgid ""
"They decided that further growth would only increase the risk of being "

msgid ""
"The minds of the first few test subjects that were uploaded were broken "
"beyond repair."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For some others the procedure lead to major issues, but eventually the "
"scientists working on project Thurion managed to solve them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first successfully uploaded test subject did not even realize just what "
"kind of experiment was conducted on them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scientists, after being uploaded and rescued from the bunker, did not "
"notice any changes in their personalities or thought patterns either and "
"concluded that the method works flawless."
msgstr ""

msgid "Soon enough they started to upload further humans."
msgstr ""

msgid "However, after some cycles issues began to manifest."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Their minds started to break down which is visible in random changes of "
"personality and the appearance of mental illnesses that grow worse over time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although the initial symptoms are rather harmless, the Thurion realized that "
"they had little time left to solve this issue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They came to the conclusion that the source of the problem are certain "
"neuronal patterns that emerged within their simulations and do not naturally "
"occur."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Working under pressure they did not find a way to fix the simulation methods "
"but came up with a rather hacky fix instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They used the previously established communication network that allows "
"uploaded Thurion to directly interact with each others and made a machine "
"learning algorithm that used this network to directly access the Thurions' "
"minds and cross-reference their neuronal patterns."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The program is then identifying the abnormal neuronal patterns and resets "
"them to their 'natural' state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since this method apparently has been very successful and the problems "
"stopped the Thurion did not further investigate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Again, since they needed to work under pressure and did not have enough time "
"for proper testing they failed to see the long term effects that this hotfix "
"would have."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Somehow, some form of gestalt consciousness has slowly formed over time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It emerged from the collective behavior associated with the interactions of "
"the uploaded Thurions' minds conveyed by the aforementioned algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The gestalt consciousness works and thinks fairly different from a human "
"mind and originally had little to no influence over the uploaded Thurion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Over time its influence over their minds has grown but the uploaded Thurion "
"were affected to greatly varying extends."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some Thurion were barely affected while for others the gestalt consciousness "

"Under the influence of the gestalt consciousness the infrastructure in the "

"colonized prior to the incident and the Thurion began to expand quickly."
msgstr ""

msgid "They have acquired enough biological population to survive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shortly after the incident they began to send scouts into the nebula to "
"investigate the situation and eventually help the few survivors on their "
"side of the galaxy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All survivors were integrated into their society and the Thurion started "
"research on surviving the harsh condition within the nebula."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once countermeasures were invented the Thurion started to quickly expand in "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By salvaged the debris they found they were able to expand their "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of their infrastructure is highly automated and operated by uploaded "
"Thurion."
msgstr ""

msgid "Human resources are rare and thus valuable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the Thurion found a path through the Sol nebula towards the rest of the "
"galaxy the gestalt consciousness decided to prepare a war against the Empire."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It was influential enough at this point to manipulate the majority of the "
"Thurion into supporting the war."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When asked about their reasons most Thurion would tell about the crimes of "
"the Empire and about their utopian ideals which they still believe in but "
"sadly are no longer able to act according to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The gestalt consciousness became obsessed by hunger for power and the "
"easiest way to satisfy it is to upload more human minds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only few of the uploaded Thurion have ever noticed the gestalt consciousness."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of those were manipulated by it to think the gestalt consciousness is "
"harmless or even beneficial and has no influence over individuals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of uploaded Thurion who know the truth is tiny and the gestalt "
"consciousness is able to use its limited influence over those individuals to "
"stop them from taking any successful actions against it."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A large part of combat is not only direct damage, but electronic warfare "
"between the evasive and sensing abilities of ships."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Electronic warfare plays a large role in determining when ships are seen, "
"how well weapons track or lock onto ships, and stealth abilities of hips."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are fundamentally three different levels, from coarse to fine:"
msgstr ""

msgid "1. Detection and hiding"
msgstr ""

msgid "1. Signature and tracking"
msgstr ""

msgid "1. Stealth"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All electronic warfare values are based on distances, since they represent "
"the distance at which the ship is fully detected."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Scanning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever you target a ship, your ship will begin performing a scan on it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is indicated by the rotating icon on the ship tab that appears in your "
"ship's interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the icon stops rotating, it indicates that the ship has been scanned."

"By pressing the <%= \"#b\"..naev.keyGet(\"scan\")..\"#0\" %> key, you can "
"call up the information about the scanned ship."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will show you things such as the outfits the ship has and the cargo it "

msgstr ""

msgid "Similarly, other ships will scan your ship when targeting it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is usually not a problem, however, if you are carrying outfits or "

"bring repercussions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ships scanning your are shown on the overlay and if you have illegal items, "
"it will temporarily stop [autonav](mechanics/autonav)."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Detection and Hiding"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without modifiers, ships are detected based on [their mass](mechanics/mass)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In particular, they are detected at a distance of `mass^(1.0/1.8) * 350` "
"which amounts to about 6,513 km for a Llama with 193 tonnes of mass, or "
"43,278 km for a Goddard with 5,834 tonnes of mass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This value gets reduced by the **Detection** bonus of the detecting ship, "
"and multiplied by the **Detection Range** of the ship being detected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since this value determines the base signature and stealth values of the "
"ship, it can play a significant role in electronic warfare."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Detecting Space Objects and Jumps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For detecting general objects such as jump points or asteroids, the "
"detection distance has a base value of 7,500 km."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This distance can be modified by values such as how well hidden the jump is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For space objects such as planets or stations the base value is 20,000 km, "
"subject to the individual properties of the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Signature and Tracking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Electronic warfare plays a critical war in combat too through evasion and "
"tracking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A ship's signature range represents how well a ship can avoid being tracked "
"by enemy weapons and is 75% of the detection value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The value can be further modified by the **Signature Range** modifier of the "
"ship, and decreased by the **Tracking** bonus of the enemy ship."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ships will be able to identify other ships if they are closer than their "
"signature range, otherwise they will be shown an \"Unknown\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Almost all forward weapons have either an amount of swivel, which allows "
"them to aim slightly at the target."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Furthermore, turret weapons can aim the entire 360° and shoot at ships in "
"any directions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Weapons try to compensate for target velocities for accurate shots, however, "
"this is reduced based on the signature range of the target ship."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In particular, weapons have a minimum tracking range, and maximum tracking "
"range."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any ship with a signature range above the maximum tracking range will be "
"aimed at nearly perfectly, barring sudden accelerations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the other hand, any ship with a signature range below the minimum "
"tracking range will not be locked onto, and the shoots will aim at the "
"current position, not correcting velocity."
msgstr ""

msgid "For in-between values it will be interpolated linearly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, the lock-on time of launchers is modified by the signature range "
"of the target and tracking values of the launcher."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target has a signature range above the maximum tracking range, the "
"lock-on time will be unmodified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target has a signature range below the maximum tracking range, it "
"will not be able to lock on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to bolt weapons, in-between values will be interpolated linearly."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Stealth"
msgstr ""

msgid "The stealth range of a ship is based on 25% of the detection range."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there are no ships within the stealth range, the ship will be able to "
"enter stealth mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In stealth mode, the ship will be undetectable, however, it will have its "
"[movement](mechanics/movement) significantly reduced."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In particular, acceleration and turn speed will be reduced by 80%, while "
"maximum speed will be reduced by 50%."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Jumping with Stealth"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When in stealth mode, it is possible to start hyperspace jumps at three "
"times the maximum normal distance from jump points."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, when entering a system in stealth mode, the ship will drop out "
"of hyperspace sooner instead of near the jump point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Being within 2,500 units of jump points also lowers the stealth range by "
"50%, making it significantly easier to stealth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like the detection range, the scanning time of a ship is determined by its "
"mass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The time it takes to scan a ship is determined by `mass^(1/3) * 1.25`, which "
"amounts to 7.22 seconds for a Llama with 193 tonnes of mass or 22.5 seconds "
"for a Goddard with 5,834 tonnes of mass."

#. We have to correct distance to consider movement to the first point
#. d = d + pos:dist( S[1] )
#. Add the final point if necessary (it is only approximated due to djistra)
#. Correct last point, as we may want to break off in the middle of a line segment
#. We only do this if it's not on a lane
#. We would technically have to correct the distance here
#. d = d + pos:dist( S[n], target ) -- Have to correct distance again
#. Recompute correct complete distance, probably faster than correcting in most cases
#. More distance off lanes than along

"this invasion.\n"
"   \"A few decaperiods ago, General Klank had been promoted as second class "
"general, with the task to organize this invasion. The first invasion plan "
"that had been proposed to him was giving free rein to each warlord, allowing "
"them to choose which planet to invade and how to proceed. However, contrary "
"to the other generals, Klank soon realized that such a disorganized "
"invasion, with inevitable battles between warlords, would take several "
"periods, with a huge risk of ending up bogged down and vulnerable to attacks "

"most reckless of them was Lord Battleaddict, but there are also Lady "
"Bitterfight and Lord Jim. Now that the internal opposition to the plan has "

"\"Hello {player}, thank you so much for answering our hail! We really could "
"use your help,\" says a haggard sounding man over the comm. \"It's about our "
"children, my wife's and mine. We were out on a family vacation to Antica, "
"you see, and we were attacked by a gang of pirates…\"\n"
"\"And he thought he could out-fly them,\" a woman's voice pipes up. \"My "
"husband used to be a bit of a pilot, but that was back when we were still "
"dating. He would fly all the way to the Apez system to see me! Before we had "
"children…\" The woman trails off."

"The man quickly speaks up again. \"The pirates disabled our ship and we "
"thought we were goners, but when they boarded us, they took our three "
"children and left us! I tried to fight them, but they had my children with "
"knives to their necks… what was I supposed to do? So we got a tow back to "
"Brooks, but now we need to find someone who will rescue our children. We've "
"heard of your skills; will you please help us?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Rescue those children!"

msgstr ""

"You can hear that the the man is quite disappointed. \"I'm sure you have a "

"pressing…\" Before the comm is cut you can hear the woman beginning to sob "
"and the man consoling her."

"The two parents immediately begin thanking you quite profusely, spending a "
"few hectoseconds simply telling you how much they truly appreciate your "
"assistance. After a while, you realize that if these children are going to "
"be rescued this cycle, you are going to need to get started sooner rather "
"than later. \"Yes, quite right,\" the father replies. \"No need to delay any "
"longer than absolutely necessary. I don't know a whole lot, but you should "
"be able to eavesdrop on some pirates at a bar. The bar on {pnt} in the {sys} "
"system has been known to serve pirates occasionally, so stopping there would "
"be a good course of action. We will anticipate your return. Again, this "
"means so much to us.\" Before you know it, the two parents are at it again, "
"thanking you like it's all they know how to do. Before it gets really bad, "
"you bid farewell, break communication, and get on your way."

"But that is neither here nor there. Come, I will take you to the local "

"\"\n"
"   True to his word, the Dvaered liaison escorts you out of the spaceport "
"bar, and within the hour you find yourself deep inside a highly secured "
"Dvaered military complex. You are ushered into a room, in which you find a "

"he's the man in charge.\n"
"   A Dvaered soldier instructs you to take a seat."

msgid ""
"As you take the last empty seat at the table, Colonel Urnus starts the "
"meeting. \"Welcome, citizen. You know why you are here and you know what "
"this meeting is about, so let me get right to the point. We have reason to "
"believe the FLF terrorists are operating from a secret base of operations. "
"We know this base is located somewhere in the nebula, and we have recently "
"uncovered intel that indicates the base is likely to be in the {sys} system."
"\"\n"
"   One of the walls lights up, showing part of the galaxy map. The {sys} "
"system is coloured red, and it's pulsating gently.\n"
"   \"Of course, we have conducted patrols in this system, but so far without "
"result. Our sensors are severely impaired by the nebula in this system, so "
"the chances of us finding the terrorist hive by our own devices are slim. "
"Fortunately, our top strategists have come up with a ruse, one that will "
"make the FLF come to us.\"\n"
"   \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" "
"Urnus continues. The image on the wall zooms up to the {sys} system, and a "
"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them. It is important to note that the transponder will "
"work best in the Nebula, which we believe is where the base should be "
"located.\"\n"
"   The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"   \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "
"has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtedly "
"send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"As soon as the FLF ships join the battle, you and the Dvaered ships will "
"disengage and target the FLF instead. Your mission is to render at least one "
"of their ships incapable of fighting, and board it. You can then access the "
"ship's computer and download the flight log, which should contain the "
"location of the FLF base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your "
"mission will be complete.\"\n"
"   The image on the wall updates one last time, simulating the battle as "
"described by Colonel Urnus. Several FLF logos appear, which are promptly "
"surrounded by the Dvaered ones. Then the logos turn gray, indicating that "
"they've been disabled.\n"
"   \"Let me make one thing clear, citizen. You are allowed, even expected, "
"to fire on the Dvaered ships that are firing on you. However, you must make "
"it look you're on the losing side, or the FLF will not come to your aid! So, "
"do NOT disable or destroy any Dvaered ships, and make sure your own armour "
"takes a bit of a beating. This is vital to the success of the mission. Do "
"not fail.\"\n"
"   Colonel Urnus seems to have concluded his explanation, so you, having "
"spotted the obvious flaw in the Dvaereds' plan, pop the question of what "
"happens if the FLF never show up.\n"
"   \"Well,\" the Colonel muses, \"That will mean our intel was probably "

"of House Dvaered on this occasion.\" The officer nods at you, then continues "
"his briefing. \"Our forces and formation will be such that it appears we are "

"fight.\""

"The schematic updates again, this time showing several small clusters of red "

"   \"The FLF will send out wings of fighters and bombers to engage our "

"but it seems prudent to assume they will outnumber us by a fair margin. Your "

"'Beta-Storks' and the 'Beta-Hammer' and their mission will be to control "
"medium and heavy ships and to provide heavy firepower in case of need. Our "
"squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and "
"Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.\n"
"   \"The plan is the following: any ship approaching the station will be "
"assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad "
"leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is assigned to you, you will have to "
"approach the ship within 1000 km. Their security clearance code will be "
"automatically requested and processed by the system we'll install in your "
"core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to fly "
"away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.\n"

#. Drinking Aristocrat
#. Author: geekt
#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defence force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.

#. MISSION: Hot dogs from space
#. DESCRIPTION: An old man who owns a hot dog factory wants to go to space
#.
#. The old man has elevated pressure in his cochlea so he can't go to space.
#. He's getting old and wants to go to space before he dies. He owns a hot dog
#. factory and will pay you in hot dogs (food). Because of his illness, you
#. can't land on any planet outside the system (the player doesn't know this).
#.
#. NOTE: This mission is best suited in systems with 2 or more planets, but can
#. be used in any system with a planet.

#.
#. * All functions are optional. In the case they don't exist, nothing happens.
#. * ontoggle is a special case that allows the player to toggle the outfit if it exists.
#. * All functions take the pilot equipping the outfit 'p' and the pilot outfit 'po' as parameters.
#. * They are run in a shared state. All global variables will be the same for all outfits of the same type.
#. * You can use the 'mem' table to access memory for the particular outfit being used.
#. * You have access to the pilotoutfit API which is meant for manipulating po.
#. * Use the <desc_extra> field in the XML when describing what the Lua does.

#. The 'notactive' variable controls whether the outfit is considered an active
#. outfit or not. By default, it is set to nil and thus the outfit is
#. considered an active outfit. It can be used to have outfits with custom
#. descriptions or prices while not being an active outfit.
#. The onload is run once when the outfit Lua is loaded. Useful for setting up
#. variables. The passed variable is the outfit itself.
#. Called to get the extra description of the outfit. This gets appended to the
#. summary and description, and should be short. The function receives the
#. pilot p if applicable, and the current outfit o. The function should return
#. a translated string.

#. The function is run when the outfit is added to the pilot
#. The function is run when the outfit is removed from the pilot
#. The update function is run periodically every 1/3 seconds
#. 'dt' is the time elapsed since last time run in seconds
#. When the pilot is out of energy, this function triggers. Note that before
#. this triggers, 'ontoggle( p, po false, false )' will be run if it exists.
#. This is especially useful for outfits that can't be toggled, but want to
#. turn off when they run out of energy.
#. The onhit function is run when the pilot 'p' takes damage
#. armour is the amount of armour damage taken (in GJ)
#. shield is the amount of shield damage taken (in GJ)
#. attacker is the pilot that attacked
#. The onshoot function is run when the pilot 'p' shoots ANY weapon. This includes primary / secondary / instant weapon sets
#. The ontoggle function is run when the outfit is part of a toggle weapon set
#. and is toggled by the player. If it was not "on" when toggled, the on value
#. will be true, it will be false otherwise.
#. It returns a boolean whether or not the outfit was actually triggered.
#. The onstealth function runs when the pilot stealths or destealths
#. stealthed the current stealth status of the pilot
#. Run when the pilot is scanned by a scanner pilot.
#. Run when the pilot scans a target pilot.
#. The cooldown function is triggered when both cooldown starts and when
#. it ends. The done is a boolean value which indicates whether or not it
#. finished. In the case done is false, opt will indicate the number of

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets more complex. An outfit pool is created, consisting of
#. the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. In parallel, if the player can't modify their fleet and are over fleet
#. capacity, they are also considered stranded.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
#. Generate a deduplicated list.
#. Iterate to find outfits matching the size and property of the empty
#. core outfit slots.
#. Nothing to fill the slots could be found.
#. Builds the tables of required, equipped, and missing outfits.
#. Clear tables.
#. Find the number of required cores, and their default outfits.
#. Find equipped cores.
#. Build the table of missing cores.
#. Removes all non-core outfits from the ship and adds them to the inventory.

#. Library for dealing with escorts in missions.
#.
#. Can be used either to provide the player with a few perishable escorts, or provide a set of escorts the player has to follow and guard to the destination.
#.
#. Below is a simple example of a convoy that the player has to protect while it goes on to some spob.
#. ```
#. -- This is an example of using the API to provide a fleet the player has to
#. -- guard starting from the start_convoy function that sets it up
#. -- The mission will automatically fail if all the escorts die
#. function start_convoy ()
#. -- Initialize the library with the pilots the player has to escort
#. escort.init( {"Koala", "Llama"}, {faction=faction.get("Independent")} )
#. -- Set the destination target, the escorts will try to go there automagically
#. escort.setDest( spob.get("Darkshed"), "convoy success" )
#. end
#. -- This function will be run  when the player lands on the destination
#. function convoy_success ()
#. local alive = escort.num_alive()
#. -- Do something based on the number of escorts that are alive
#. do_something( alive )
#. -- Cleans up the library
#. escort.exit()
#. end
#. ```
#.
#. Below is a more complex example where the player becomes the leader and the escorts follow and protect the player.
#. ```
#. -- Initialize the library and give the player two escorts that will guard them / help them out
#. function start_convoy ()
#. escort.init( {"Lancelot", "Lancelot"}, {faction=faction.get("Mercenary"), nofailifdead=true, func_pilot_death="escort_died"} )
#. end
#. -- The escort died
#. function escort_died( _p )
#. if escort.num_alive() <= 0 then
#. -- All the escorts are dead
#. end
#. end

#.
#. In general all shaders have a "strength" parameter indicating the strength
#. of the effect. Furthermore, those that have a temporal component have a
#. "speed" parameter. These are all normalized such that 1 is the default
#. value. Temporal component can also be inverted by setting a negative value.

#. @tfield number speed Speed of the effect normalized such that 1.0 is the default value. Negative values run the effect backwards. Only used for those shaders with temporal components.
#. @tfield Colour colour Colour component to be used. Should be in the form of {r, g, b} where r, g, and b are numbers.
