.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B Naev
is a space trading and combat game, inspired by Escape Velocity.

Played from a top-down perspective with isometric sprites, the player
is free to explore the galaxy as they see fit, trading or pirating
their way to a vast fortune.

Naev is set in a futuristic science fiction environment, in which
the player finds themself in the wake of a massive galactic cataclysm
which erupted from the Sol system and destroyed everything within
tens of light years, resulting in a massive, volatile nebula.
