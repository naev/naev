The main purpose of this project is to provide an external validity check to
naev.

MAJOR:

DONE     *) first off you should make sure all the assets in asset.xml are
DONE        used by ssys.xml
DONE     *) then make sure all the techs in tech.xml are used by asset.xml
DONE     *) then :
                If something is in ship.xml or outfit.xml and not (in tech.xml
                or used by lua files) -> problem
            This assume that we have a list of outfit and ship from the lua
            files.
DONE     *) Need to double check the lua files in case of unused content
INGOING  *) Add items who needs a double check in a shared list (from
            preprocessing to readers). Then, pop the list until everything
            is done
               - readers
               - preprocessing
         *) ai/spawn/* for ships, ai/equip/* for outfits

MINOR:
         *) Verify that fleets with ships are used (ship.py@28): 
         *) Check if planets images are :
            - used and too used (eg. >10)
            - not used
            > Idea: can list planet names by 'space' category filenames
