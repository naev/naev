# NAEV README

Naev is a 2D space trading and combat game, taking inspiration from the Escape
Velocity series, among others.

You pilot a space ship from a top-down perspective, and are more or less free
to do what you want. As the genre name implies, you’re able to trade and engage
in combat at will. Beyond that, there’s an ever-growing number of storyline
missions, equipment, and ships; Even the galaxy itself grows larger with each
release. For the literarily-inclined, there are large amounts of lore
accompanying everything from planets to equipment.

## DEPENDENCIES

Naev's dependencies are intended to be relatively common. In addition to
an OpenGL-capable graphics card and driver, Naev requires the following:
* SDL (version 2 is preferred)
* libxml2
* freetype2
* libpng
* OpenAL
* libvorbis (>= 1.2.1 necessary for Replaygain)
* binutils
* libzip

Note that several distributions ship outdated versions of libvorbis, and
thus libvorbisfile is statically linked into the release binary.

Compiling your own binary on many distributions will result in Replaygain
being disabled.

### Ubuntu

Install compile-time dependencies on Ubuntu 16.04 (and hopefully later) with:

```bash
apt-get install build-essential automake libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev \
libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng12-dev libopenal-dev \
libvorbis-dev binutils-dev libzip-dev libiberty-dev autopoint intltool
```

### Other \*nix 

See http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Compiling_Nix for package lists for several
distributions.

## COMPILING

Run: 

```bash
./autogen.sh && ./configure
make
```

If you need special settings you should pass flags to configure, using -h
will tell you what it supports.

## INSTALLATION

Naev currently supports make install which will install everything that
is needed.

If you wish to create a .desktop for your desktop environment, logos
from 16x16 to 256x256 can be found in extras/logos

## WINDOWS

See http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Compiling_Win for how to compile on windows.
