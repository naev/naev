NAEV README

Naev is a 2D space trading and combat game, taking inspiration from the Escape
Velocity series, among others.

You pilot a space ship from a top-down perspective, and are more or less free
to do what you want. As the genre name implies, you’re able to trade and engage
in combat at will. Beyond that, there’s an ever-growing number of storyline
missions, equipment, and ships; Even the galaxy itself grows larger with each
release. For the literarily-inclined, there are large amounts of lore
accompanying everything from planets to equipment.
