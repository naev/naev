Contributions
---------------------------------------

   Vega Strike <http://vegastrike.sf.net>
      * Ship Models
      * Music
      * Sounds
      * Planet images
    Wouldn't have been possible without the Vega Strike team, although they didn't actively participate, by allowing me to use their data they did me a great favour and let me concentrate on the coding.

   Joel Hans <wolorf@gmail.com>
      * Planet Graphics
      * Render Script
    Helped out when the project was starting. Great morale booster.

   Amir Taaki <genjix@gmail.com>
   Rob Loach <http://robloach.net>
      * SDL_collide
    Although we don't use the SDL_collide library itself, it was inspirational for Naev's own collision routines.

   Pete Shinners <pete@shinners.org>
      * SavePNG
    Great function ripped straight out of pygame. Works marvelously!
   
   Aurore D. "Rore" <aurore.d@gmail.com>
      * Planet gimp script
    Saved a lot of trouble by allowing us to quickly create space planet graphics.

   Andrew Mustun
      * Sprite gimp script
    Although not used directly, it helped create our own sprite script.

   J.C. Wilk
      * Turbulence noise
    After the horrible failure of our own plasma fractal attempt, TCOD's turbulence noise seemed to do everything perfectly where we screwed up. With heavy optimization the code was introduced to Naev.

   Jordi Pegueroles Queralt "pegue" <j.pegueroles.queralt@gmail.com>
      * Mace Rocket model

   Brian J. Cameron
      * Much artwork
    Talented artist, one of the first in creating custom naev content.

   Camilo Polymeris <cpolymeris@gmx.net>
      * Art and code
    Great to see someone else working on Naev code and Lua documentation.

   Dimitry Marakasov
      * FreeBSD port and CMake
    Talented coder who did the first official port of Naev.

   Elderman
      * Many cool missions
    The first non-bobbens mission developer!  Great focus on dialogues.

   Ingo Ruhnke <grumbel@gmx.de>
      * NPC Portraits
    The entire mission overhaul wouldn't have been possible without grumbel's portraits.

   Alexandru Mosoi <brtzsnr@gmail.com>
      * Coded cool features
    First non-bobbens coder to make serious commits! Like the reason the maps are all over or the faction in the maps.

   Peter Johnson <zid@zid.yggdrasil.sk>
      * Sped up nebula generation by a lot

   Unavowed <unavowed@vexillium.org>
      * Ported Naev's build system to autotools.
    Probably the cleanest autotools implementation I've ever seen.

   Felix Schneider "Scaatis" <fsfuenf@gmail.com>
      * New Logo, svgized some of the texturized svgs of other logos.
   And thus the bobbens logo became dust.

   Enigmatic
      * Ships for the Great House Sirius and many other great 3D models
   He pumps out models like there's no tomorrow!

   Cypher3c <cypher3c@gmail.com>
      * Spiced up the boring generic cargo missios.

   Fisherman
      * Threading code to speed up nebula generation (and in the future who knows?)
      * Hot dog mission

   Ludovic Belli√®re "xrogaan"
      * Python programmer extraordinaire
   His utilities save gray hairs for everyone.

   Josh Combs
      * Artist of most of the nebulae.

   Devin Khan
      * Modeller
