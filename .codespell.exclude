The only reason you are in my office and not in a holding cell is because one of my trusted colleagues is vouching for you." The officer leans a little closer to you and pins you with a level stare. "I don't think you're a Dvaered spy. The Dvaered don't have the wit to pull off decent espionage. But you shouldn't get any ideas of running to the Dvaered and blabbing about our presence here. They're neither a trusting nor a grateful sort, so they'd probably just arrest you and torture you for what you know. So, I trust you understand that your discretion is in both our interests."]]), {player=player.name()}))

One thing is for certain though, a few blaster shots aren't enough to explain the explosion which clearly took place here. You do find a singed journal in the captain's pocket however, and start leafing through the most recent entries.]]))

You decide to be discreet, asking them if they've ever heard of a certain Sauterfeldt. Upon hearing this, the trio visibly relaxes. They tell you that indeed they know the man you speak of, and that they have something of his in their possession. Things proceed smoothly from that point, and several hectoseconds later you are back at your ship, preparing it for takeoff while you wait for the agents to bring you your cargo.]]))
